accuracy/mistranslation - ""price guarantee agreement for the roof"" for ""保价协议"" (price guarantee agreement). The addition of ""for the roof"" is incorrect and nonsensical in this context.
accuracy/mistranslation - ""the price of the damages compensation for the roof"" for ""差价赔付"" (difference compensation). The translation is convoluted and nonsensical. ""Difference compensation"" would be a more accurate and understandable translation. The phrase ""for the roof"" is hallucinated again.
accuracy/mistranslation - ""building in Jiangbei New District claiming that the price of the damages compensation for the roof"" for ""位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”"". The entire clause is mistranslated, leading to a confusing and inaccurate rendering of the source text.
accuracy/mistranslation - ""before handing over other housing sources are more favorable than the previous discount"" for ""在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣"". The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not accurately reflect the meaning of the source text, which refers to better deals being available on other properties before handover.
accuracy/mistranslation - ""buy housing for people change and reimburse the price"" for ""为买房人换房并退还差价"" (exchange houses for buyers and refund the price difference). The translation is awkward and grammatically incorrect. The phrase should be more accurately translated as ""exchange houses for buyers and refund the price difference"".

minor: style/unnatural flow - ""expand the connectivity of Macau to Macau and the travel market"" is redundant and doesn't quite make sense. It should be more clearly worded to reflect the intention of connecting Hong Kong and Macau tourism.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: accuracy/wrong named entity - ""Suguj Holding Company"" is a mistranslation of ""杉杉控股有限公司 (Shanshan Holding Co., Ltd.)"". The translated named entity is completely different from the source.
[Major]: accuracy/mistranslation - ""WeChat public notice"" is a mistranslation of ""微信公众号 (WeChat official account)"". This changes the meaning of the original text as a ""WeChat official account"" is a specific type of account on the WeChat platform, not just any public notice on WeChat.
[Minor]: accuracy/mistranslation - The phrase ""died on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65 due to sudden cardiac illness and ineffective treatment"" is a more verbose rendering of the original Chinese. Although the meaning remains, the language is unnecessarily wordy. A more concise translation such as ""died of a sudden heart attack on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65"" would be more accurate.

This also appears to be an attribution error since Wu Yeonggang sounds like a real person.
minor: grammar/article - ""Susuk's clothes"" should be ""Shanshan's clothes"" - It should be 'Shanshan's clothes'. However, the translation already uses ""Susuk's clothes"", and this annotation focuses on linguistic errors.

690,我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。,"I think the novella, as well as the title, is a kind of acting art, the author wants to convey that love is more than just the parting on stage and the sea of urban legends, not only that the love of me is like paint, love is not only above and should not be represented above, love is also life is bland like water, dull tasteless day after day, there are also the speechlessness of life, the escape from reality, the restlessness of the future.",terminology,"```

[Minor]: [CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE/idiom] - The phrase ""The law is dead, man is alive"" is a literal translation of a Chinese idiom, but it may not be immediately understandable or have the same cultural resonance for an English-speaking audience. A more common English equivalent might be ""Rules are rules, but people are people"" or a similar sentiment conveying flexibility within established guidelines."

[Major]: accuracy/mistranslation - ""I'll either get it myself, or get a courier to buy it for me"" doesn't capture the full meaning of the source text. The source text implies that the speaker was *told* to either accept the item or have the courier buy it, putting the speaker in a position where they are forced to choose between these two options. The translation doesn't convey this.
[Minor]: accuracy/mistranslation - ""why do I give people money to buy things that I don't buy?"" is a mistranslation of ""我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？"". It should be something like: ""why should I let other people pay for something they didn't buy?"".

Minor: Accuracy/Mistranslation - ""Amazon offer is very good, direct delivery to our website"" should be ""Amazon has great discounts, and the product was directly shipped from the official Zhou Shengsheng website."" The source text ""亚马逊优惠力度真大，周生生官网直接发货"" refers to the discounts offered on Amazon and the direct shipment from the official website of Zhou Shengsheng (a jewelry brand). The current translation is inaccurate and misleading.
Minor: Unnatural Flow - ""I ordered last night and received it this afternoon, very fast."" While grammatically correct, it sounds slightly unnatural. A better wording might be ""I ordered it the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon, very fast."""

The original Chinese mentions that the design is meant to *prevent* the ABS surface from being scratched.

Style Errors:
minor: Unnatural Flow - The phrase ""easy-to-find shop"" is an unnatural translation of ""某易"". While ""某"" can mean ""certain"" or ""some"", in this context referring to an online marketplace like ""某易"" (likely NetEase), translating it directly to ""easy-to-find shop"" makes the sentence sound awkward and less fluent in English. A better approach would be to identify the actual online store if possible, or use a more general term like ""a certain online store.""
minor: Unnatural Flow - The phrase ""it's good"" is a somewhat unnatural way to translate ""还不错"". Although not strictly incorrect, ""it's good"" is rather basic and doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""还不错,"" which implies ""not bad"" or ""pretty good."" It could be rephrased for better flow, for example, by adding additional details or being combined with other sentences.
minor: Unnatural Flow - The sentence ""it still feels good after all"" at the end is an awkward way to express ""毕竟感觉还不错"". The word ""毕竟"" here suggests the speaker is reaffirming their positive impression based on past experience. The translated sentence comes across as a bit clunky and doesn't flow naturally. A more natural phrasing would be something like ""since I still like them""."

Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""easy-to-find shop"" does not accurately reflect the original term ""某易 (mǒu yì)"". It is likely a misinterpretation of a specific online retailer's name, so the use of generic term is inaccurate.

accuracy/addition - ""well,"" is added and doesn't reflect the original meaning.
accuracy/mistranslation - ""not what I said it was not difficult to hear,"" is an awkward and inaccurate rendering of ""不是我说的难听"" (bu shi wo shuo de nan ting), which means ""it's not that I'm trying to be harsh.""
