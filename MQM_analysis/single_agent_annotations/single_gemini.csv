2,"除非有人自愿维护, EURo文件，Info文件是权威文档.",EURo and Info documents are authoritative unless someone volunteers to maintain them.,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Omission - The translation omits the condition that 'unless someone volunteers to maintain them' the EURo and Info documents are authoritative. The original Chinese text implies that if there IS someone who maintains these documents, they become more authoritative than the official ones. The translation makes it sound like these are always the authoritative documents *unless* someone volunteers, which reverses the meaning.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - Using ""authoritative"" implies a level of official recognition or legal standing which might not be accurate. ""Definitive"" or ""canonical"" could be better choices depending on the exact context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[No Error]:

Style Errors
[Minor]: Unnatural flow - ""unless someone volunteers to maintain them"" is slightly awkward. Rewording to ""unless they are actively maintained"" could improve the flow.

3,"如果发现手册页和软件之间有所矛盾,请查对Info","If you find a discrepancy between the manual pages and the software, please consult Info","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""查对"" can be translated more simply as ""check"" or ""refer to."" ""Consult"" is not inaccurate, but it feels slightly more formal and suggests a deeper level of engagement than the original implies.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Info"" refers to the GNU Info system, a help documentation system. Using ""Info"" directly might not be immediately clear to all English speakers who are not familiar with the specific software context. It would be more helpful to say ""the Info documentation"" or ""the Info system"".

Linguistic Convention Errors

Style Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""Gnu cc"" should be ""GNU C Compiler"" for clarity to the audience. While technically not inaccurate, it's less clear than it could be.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""Hii(compilation)"" should be just ""compilation"" or more accurately, ""compiling."" The original text seems to have an error or typo (""Hii""). It's not a common term in compiler processes.
[Major]: [Omission] - ""MERE"" is not translated. It most likely is a typo of ""Linking"" and it's better to translate it.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While technically ""compilation"" is part of the process, in this context, ""compiling"" sounds more natural.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Punctuation errors] - There should be a comma before ""and"" in the list of steps.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - ""后绥名"" translates to ""suffix"", but the context implies it refers to ""file extension"". While technically correct, it lacks nuance and could be improved.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - The phrase ""缺省设定"" is translated to ""default setting"". In a programming context, ""default configuration"" or ""default behavior"" would be more appropriate.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""connection to the form c"" is a slightly awkward and overly literal rendering of the intended meaning, which refers to linking conventions for C code.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""connection"" is not the most suitable term here. ""Linking"" or ""linkage"" would be more appropriate in the context of compiling and linking code.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - The phrase ""to be a c file"" could be improved to ""to be a C file"" (capitalization)

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The entire sentence is a nonsensical and inaccurate rendering of the Chinese source. ""RE AS E ' -x' option"" doesn't make sense in context, and the overall meaning is lost. The sentence structure is flawed and does not reflect the original meaning.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The sentence is very difficult to understand, hinting that the provided string might be related to turning off language declarations in filename suffix processing, but fails to convey the original instruction.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""explicit language pronouncements"" is an inappropriate translation. It doesn't have a clear equivalent meaning in English in this context.
[Major]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""filename suffix processing"" is understandable in the context but reads awkward as a direct translation and could be worded in a more natural English phrasing.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Major]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""that are consequent to the filename suffix processing the file behind the RE AS E ' -x' option"" is grammatically incorrect and difficult to parse. The sentence structure is awkward and unnatural.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The phrase ""在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作"" translates to ""using pipes instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process."" The current translation alters the meaning and order, leading to some inaccuracies regarding the context of ""using pipes instead of temporary files.""
[Minor]: [Omission] - The translation omits the initial part of the sentence that introduces the context of using pipes instead of temporary files in the compilation process. This is necessary to understand the reason behind the GNU compiler's advantage.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While acceptable, using ""compiler"" for ""assembler"" could be more precise as the original text discusses assemblers (汇编器). This might confuse someone familiar with compilation pipelines.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - The sentence structure is a little awkward. The phrase ""the compiler can accept C ""dialects"" to work between different stages of the compilation process"" is not the most natural way to express the idea.

Style Errors

The original sentence discusses turning off certain features *despite* the use of standard libraries. The ""unix and vax"" example seems to relate to ANSI trigraphs which is also not accurately conveyed, making the sentence confusing. It should mention something like ""indicating compliance (or catering) to rarely used ANSI trigraph features"" and ""disabling despite usage"".

[Major]: [mistranslation/inaccurate] - The translation ""double-coded characters components and 9 double-coded characters"" isn't precise; it should describe that they have duplicate codes. It would be better to say ""6 character components with duplicate codes and 9 characters with duplicate codes.""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using the term ""characters components"" may not be the most common way to refer to ""汉字构件"". A more common term might be ""character radicals"" or ""character components.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/punctuation] - The phrase ""and its"" should be ""and that"". This correction improves clarity and grammatical correctness.

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The English sentence structure is a bit awkward and could be improved for better readability. For example: ""The GB/I 13000 code positions for 10 vertical punctuation marks and 8 character components in the two-byte coding area were changed, excluding 6 character components and 9 characters with duplicate codes (see Appendix D, Appendix A of the 2005 edition).""

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""Added characters and part/parts of the appendix have been removed"" is a mistranslation of the source text. The source states that the appendix containing ""added characters and radicals/components"" has been removed. The translation implies that the characters themselves were removed, rather than the appendix. Also, ""part/parts"" should be ""radicals/components"".

Terminology Errors
[Major]: [Incorrect term choice] - The term ""part/parts"" is a vague and inaccurate translation of ""部首/部件"" which refers to radicals and components of Chinese characters.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - ""第9草"" is mistranslated as ""Figure 9"". It should be ""Draft 9"" or ""Version 9"". This significantly alters the meaning.
Terminology Errors
[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - ""Implementation"" is not the best term here. ""Level of detail"", ""degree of implementation"" or similar may be better depending on the context. However, the meaning is understandable.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Linguistic Convention - Missing article ""the"". ""increase the level of implementation"" is acceptable but ""increase *the* level of implementation"" sounds more natural.

Style Errors
[Major]: Awkward expressions - ""Increase the level of implementation"" sounds unnatural. Rewording is needed. A more natural phrasing depends on the precise meaning but could be something like ""increase the detail of the implementation"", or ""enhance the implementation"".

The translation misses the part about the ""Table of General Standard Chinese Characters; Code Location of the Character 议"".
[Major]: [over-translation] - ""ISO alphabetical alphabetical list"" is redundant. The original text does not imply a list with redundant repetition of the word alphabetical.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""the word in question"" is too vague for ""议字"". A more precise term like ""the character '议'"" would be better.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""four bytes"" implies data size in computer science.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The translation incorrectly claims that the novelty psychoactive substance found in syringes was ""mercury."" The source text only mentions ""新型精神活性物质"" (novelty psychoactive substance) and doesn't specify mercury. This is a significant factual error.
[Major]: [Addition] - Addition of 'mercury' when it is not in the source text.
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - The phrase ""产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质"" translates to ""novel psychoactive substances that produce a stimulating effect"" or ""novel psychoactive stimulant substances."" The translation ""a novelty psychoactive substance, mercury, that has a stimulant effect"" is grammatically awkward and creates a misunderstanding that the novelty psychoactive substance *is* mercury and that *mercury* has stimulant effects, which is inaccurate given the broader context.

The Chinese source text says ""在美国最早通过立法的两个州"", which translates more literally to ""In the two states in the US that first passed legislation"".

[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The nuance of ""受到忽视"" is not fully captured by ""are ignored"". A more accurate translation would be ""are overlooked"" or ""are underestimated"". While ""ignored"" isn't completely wrong, it implies a deliberate act of disregard, whereas ""overlooked"" or ""underestimated"" suggests a lack of awareness or insufficient attention, which is closer to the original meaning.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While ""opioids"" is a correct translation of ""阿片类药物,"" it's somewhat technical. A simpler term like ""opioid drugs"" might be more suitable for a general audience.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - It could be argued the English sentence is slightly awkward. Adding ""because"" before ""fewer people take them"" would improve the flow. ""However, the associated dangers of opioids are ignored because fewer people take them.""

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Awkward expressions] - The sentence sounds a bit clunky. Rephrasing as ""However, the dangers associated with opioid use are often overlooked due to their relatively low usage rates"" might sound more natural.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""Z-shaped earsail"" is not an accurate translation of the Chinese text. The term ""ear sail"" doesn't make sense. The sentence after suggests a method to adjust it, implying a fitting component of the headphone.
[Critical]: [mistranslation/omission] - The meaning of ""如有了觉不适过以要底文二融小虽机外"" is not accurately translated. This part discusses adjustment or replacement options related to the eartips or ear fins. The translation only mentions removing it.

Terminology Errors
[Major]: [incorrect term choice] - ""earsail"" is not a standard term. Eartip or earfin would be more appropriate depending on the context.

Linguistic Convention Errors

[Critical]: [mistranslation] - The phrase ""以轻摆头部耳机不田动为家"" is mistranslated. The intended meaning is ""make sure the headphones don't move when you lightly shake your head"" or similar. The translation ""and hold the headphones in place with the head lightly"" is inaccurate and does not convey the correct meaning.
[Major]: [omission] - The translation omits the part about ""不田动为家,"" which means ensuring the headphones stay in place even with slight head movement.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Headset"" is a generally acceptable term, but in this context, ""earphones"" or ""earbuds"" would be more precise as it refers to something inserted into the ear canal.

The original meaning is about ending a call, not unplugging or cutting off the phone from music.

106,来电时，拒听电话通话时，切换至耳机/手机听简双击,"When incoming calls are rejected, switch to headphones / cell phone to listen to short double taps","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - The phrase ""简双击"" (jian shuang ji) which means ""short double tap"" refers to an action. The translation interprets it as something to ""listen to"" which makes no sense in context. It is likely that the ""short double tap"" action enables the phone to switch audio output to headphones/cell phone.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - The meaning of the first part of the sentence ""来电时，拒听电话通话时"" is not fully accurate. It refers to when rejecting an incoming call or during a phone call.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Cell phone"" is less common than ""phone"" or ""speaker"" in this context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The phrase ""to listen to short double taps"" is ungrammatical.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The numeral ""1"" in the translation is completely incorrect and absent in the original Chinese text. This fundamentally changes the meaning of the input parameter range. The input parameter should indicate a range of current values, e.g., 5 to 500mA. The insertion of '1' is misleading.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Input parameter"" is a somewhat literal translation. Depending on the context, ""Input"" or ""Input Range"" could be more appropriate. However, this doesn't significantly hinder understanding.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Punctuation errors] - The space before ""1"" after the number ""5"" is unnatural. It should be removed, and the ""1"" should also be removed based on the source text.

148,2月10日，中国理财网发布首批个人养老金理财产品名单，工银理财、农银理财和中邮理财的7只个人养老金理财产品正式发售。,"On February 10, China Financial Network released the first batch of personal pension product lists, seven personal pension products from China Bank Financial, Farmers Bank Financial, and China Post Financial were officially launched.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""中国理财网"" should be translated as ""China Wealth Management Network"" instead of ""China Financial Network"". While technically related, ""Wealth Management"" is a more accurate representation of the entity's function.
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - ""工银理财、农银理财和中邮理财"" translates to the wealth management subsidiaries of ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, and Postal Savings Bank of China respectively. The translation ""China Bank Financial, Farmers Bank Financial, and China Post Financial"" lacks precision as it doesn't explicitly identify them as subsidiaries or convey the proper names. A more accurate rendering would be ""ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management, and Postal Savings Bank of China Wealth Management"" or similar.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - Using ""launched"" is acceptable, but ""released for sale"" or ""offered for sale"" might be more specific and appropriate in a financial context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[No Error]

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Unnatural flow] - The sentence structure is a bit clunky. A slightly smoother flow could be achieved by rephrasing.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""shops"" should be ""the organization's stores"" or ""locations"". The Chinese text refers to the branches of the organization, not general shops.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""collapse of the runway"" is an incorrect translation of ""倒闭跑路"". It should be ""collapse and absconding"" or ""bankruptcy and fleeing"".

","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - The translation inaccurately portrays the sentence structure and meaning. The Chinese sentence is asking *why* members are immediately panicking when fitness outlets temporarily close, suggesting they *should* be calm. The English translation turns it into a statement about the outlet closure, then asks if that's a big deal.
[Major]: [addition] - ""or not"" is added at the end, which isn't present in the original Chinese text and alters the meaning.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Physical fitness outlets"" is a slightly awkward and less common way to refer to ""fitness centers"" or ""gyms.""

Linguistic Convention Errors

[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""is often broadcast"" is not the best translation of ""频频传出"". A more accurate translation would be ""is frequently reported"" or ""are often heard"". ""Broadcast"" implies a formal media outlet, while ""频频传出"" has a broader sense of being spread through various channels.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The phrase “不过条件却不低” is mistranslated as ""but its conditions are not bad."" A more accurate translation would be ""but the conditions are quite demanding"" or ""but the conditions are not easy to meet."" The original Chinese implies that the conditions are strict or difficult, not just ""not bad.""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Price guarantee agreement"" is an acceptable translation of “保价协议”, but it might be slightly more natural to say ""price protection agreement"" or even just ""price guarantee."" This is a very minor point.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - The phrase ""It is true that a lot of buyers believe..."" is a bit wordy. A more concise construction would be ""Many buyers believe...""

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Awkward expressions] - The phrase ""provides buyers with a certain security"" is a bit awkward. It would be smoother to say ""offers buyers some security"" or ""gives buyers peace of mind.""

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Incorrect name] - ""郑女士"" (Ms. Zheng) is mistranslated as ""Mrs. Yang"".

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""toothless structure of the upper dental restoration"" is an awkward and inaccurate translation of ""上部牙修复体的缺牙修复方式"". It should be more like ""a way to restore missing teeth using upper dental prosthetics"". The original sentence implies the restoration *replaces* missing teeth, rather than being a ""toothless structure"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Dental restoration technique"" could be slightly improved. ""Dental implant"" or ""dental implant procedure"" would be better. While technically not wrong, it's less precise.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""which is based on the implantation of lower structures in bone tissue to support and fix the toothless structure of the upper dental restoration.""

[Minor]: [incorrect term choice/technical] - Using ""WLAN"" multiple times is technically correct, but repeating the full abbreviation is slightly stylistically awkward, especially in consecutive clauses. It would be more natural to use ""WLAN"" initially, and then use ""Wi-Fi"" or ""wireless"" for subsequent mentions.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/word order] - ""...promote local WLAN upgrades to concentrate..."" could be improved by using ""in"" before concentrate - ""...promote local WLAN upgrades in densely populated areas...""

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow/awkward expression] - The phrase ""provide gigabit access capabilities"" is somewhat awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""provide gigabit access"" or ""enable gigabit speeds"".

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""带货"" (dài huò) means ""live-streaming e-commerce"" or ""sales through live broadcasts,"" not ""consignment."" Also, the translation implies that the content *of the consignment* is the kingpin, which is not what the source means. The source refers to the importance of content creation in the business of live-streaming commerce.
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""How could the content have been the kingpin"" significantly changes the meaning. The question should be about *how to make content the kingpin*.
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""涌现“新变量”"" translated as ""the emergence of a new variable"". The ""new variable"" refers to a shift or new trend in the e-commerce industry, not literally a single variable.

Style Errors
[Major]: [awkward phrasing] - ""How could the content of a consignment have been the kingpin..."" is an awkward construction.
[Minor]: [unnatural flow] - The question sounds stilted.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Named Entity] - ""Dongyang e-commerce"" is likely a mistranslation or misidentification of the e-commerce platform. The source text says ""抖音电商"", which translates to ""Douyin e-commerce"" (Douyin is the Chinese name for TikTok).
[Minor]: [Addition/Stylistic] - ""90-s-plus girl"" is an overly literal and awkward translation. A better phrasing would be ""a woman in her 30s"" or ""a 90s-born woman"".

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""融资融券交易业务"" is translated to ""funding and securities trading business"". A more accurate translation would be ""margin trading and securities lending business"" or ""securities margin trading business.""
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""接受投资者委托，向北交所进行融资融券交易申报"" is translated to ""accept the investors as their delegate for declaring funding and securities transactions to the Beijing Stock Exchange."" This is grammatically awkward and alters the meaning slightly.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - The abbreviation ""LME"" is used throughout the translation, but it actually refers to the Beijing Stock Exchange (北交所). This is a critical error because it completely misidentifies the entity involved.
[Major]: Mistranslation - ""融资融券标的股票名单"" translates to ""list of stocks eligible for margin trading and securities lending"" or ""list of stocks that can be used for margin financing and securities lending,"" but the translation says ""list of stocks and bonds to be financed by the LME."" This is inaccurate.
[Major]: Mistranslation - ""可充抵保证金证券名单"" translates to ""list of securities eligible as collateral"" or ""list of securities that can be used as margin collateral,"" but the translation says ""list of collateralized securities."" This is inaccurate and sounds like the securities are already being used as collateral.
[Minor]: Over-translation - The translation contains the phrase ""LME-financed securities information section"". While this is technically related to ""融资融券信息"", which roughly translates to ""margin financing and securities lending information"", the addition of ""LME-financed"" is redundant and adds an unnecessary layer of interpretation.

Terminology Errors
[Major]: Incorrect term choice - While ""financed"" isn't technically wrong, in the context of margin trading and securities lending, terms like ""eligible for margin trading"" or ""eligible for margin financing"" are more appropriate.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Style - Awkward phrasing - ""will be made available to investors by means of the LME-financed securities information section"" is a bit awkward. ""Will be available to investors in the LME's margin trading and securities lending information section"" is better.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The original text mentions ""司警局"" which refers to the Judiciary Police, not ""the police in the district of Daqing"". Daqing is a city in China and is completely unrelated to the context. This is a critical mistranslation as it completely changes the meaning and location of the event.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""不法分子假冒本澳电讯公司"" is mistranslated as ""the criminals impersonated BAN TELEXAN S.A."". It should be translated as ""criminals impersonating local telecommunication companies"". BAN TELEXAN S.A. is an arbitrary company name and the meaning is changed.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""以积分到期须尽快换领奖赏为饵"" is mistranslated as ""the user had to exchange their reward for the score as soon as possible"". It should be translated to ""using expiring points as bait to lure them to redeem rewards as soon as possible"".
[Minor]: [Omission] - The word ""事主"" which refers to ""victim"" is omitted.

304,亲临考察引入澳门旅游新玩法,Visitors to Macau introduced a new way of exploring Macau,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The original Chinese text implies that someone (likely officials or tourism authorities) personally visited/inspected and *then* introduced new tourism methods. The translation suggests visitors themselves introduced the new methods. This misses the key nuance of *who* introduced the new methods.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Exploring Macau"" is not incorrect, but ""new ways to experience Macau"" or ""new tourist attractions in Macau"" might be a more nuanced fit depending on the full context of the document.

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Awkward expressions] - ""Visitors to Macau introduced a new way..."" is grammatically correct, but somewhat stiff. It could be rephrased for better flow, e.g., ""Macau introduces new tourist experiences"" or ""A new way to experience Macau"".

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""This is the first time that"" is an addition. The original Chinese text does not imply this is the first time a delegation of this kind has visited Macau.
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - ""Connectivity of Macau to Macau"" should be ""connectivity of Hong Kong to Macau"", or, more accurately, ""joint travel"" since ""联线同游"" implies promoting combined travel itineraries rather than literal connectivity.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Netizens from travel"" is awkward. Should be ""travel bloggers/influencers"".

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - ""bring new ways of Macau tourism to Hong Kong residents and visitors"" should be ""bring new Macau tourism experiences to Hong Kong residents and visitors"". Grammatically awkward and not very clear.

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow] - The sentence ""and use the advantages of Hong Kong's transportation hub to expand the connectivity of Macau to Macau and the travel market"" is awkwardly phrased. A better phrasing would be: ""and leverage Hong Kong's transportation hub advantages to expand the joint Hong Kong-Macau travel market"".

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""time and space touring, the 3 Bars, the Big Bar Bar"" is a complete mistranslation of ""时空穿梭‧游历三巴” —— 大三巴牌坊沉浸式数字体验展"" which refers to an immersive digital experience exhibition related to the Ruins of St. Paul's. This is critical as it makes no sense in English.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""Macau Wine and Cheeses Old City"" is a mistranslation of ""澳品荟、氹仔旧城区"" which refers to a collection of Macau products and the old city of Taipa.
[Minor]: [omission] - ""Motorcycle"" should be ""Grand Prix"" in ""Macau Motorcycle Museum"" which refers to Macau Grand Prix Museum.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The original text refers to ""Macau + tourism,"" a concept describing the integration of tourism with other industries. This is mistranslated as ""Macau + Macau tourism firsthand,"" which is redundant and doesn't convey the original meaning.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The text states that another visit is being organised ""this time"". The translation has ""this year"" which isn't correct.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The translation states the representatives are going to ""Australia"". This should be ""Macau""
[Major]: [Addition] - ""...and the industry is negotiating to expand the port-to-port connections between Hong Kong and Macau..."" This is inaccurate. The original text discusses collaboration between the industries to develop a ""joint travel route"" for Hong Kong and Macau, not port-to-port connections. It's more about tourism packages than physical port connections.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Netizens"" is a slightly awkward term. Perhaps ""online influencers"" or ""social media personalities"" would be a better translation of ""网红"".

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/entity] - The translation states ""Chinese medical team members in China"". The original text refers to Chinese medical team members *aiding* or *assisting* Central Africa, not members located *in* China. This changes the meaning of the sentence, although it is still comprehensible.
[Minor]: [over-translation/addition] - ""kindness and generosity"" are used to translate ""仁心仁术"". While both words are appropriate, together it is slightly redundant. One would suffice.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""In reply"" could be more specifically translated as ""In a letter of reply"" or ""In his reply letter"" to more accurately reflect the original Chinese text ""回信"".

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""Xiangyao Party"" is not in the original text and doesn't make sense in the context. It's a hallucination or potentially a mistranslation of a different term.
[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""Strengthen the leadership, truly grasp the roots"" is an overly literal and nonsensical translation of ""增强本领、真抓实干"". A more accurate translation would be ""Enhance capabilities, work diligently and pragmatically."" The current translation disrupts the flow.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Two maintenance pillars"" is an awkward and somewhat inaccurate translation of ""两个维护"". A better translation would be ""Two Upholds"" or ""Two Safeguards,"" depending on the context and established terminology.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""Central Party with comrade Xi Jinping at the core"" is an overly literal and slightly awkward rendering of ""以习近平同志为核心的党中央"". A more natural translation would be ""the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core"" or ""the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at the core"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""China-style modernization"" is frequently translated as ""Chinese-style modernization"". While not technically incorrect, using ""Chinese-style"" is more idiomatic and common.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: Mistranslation - ""两个确立"" (the Two Establishments) is translated as ""establishing the two pillars of the Party"". While the translation conveys a similar idea, it loses the specific political term and its significance within the Chinese political context.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - Using ""pillars"" instead of ""establishments"" or ""foundations"" (accepted translations). This loses the specific meaning of the established political term.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Accuracy/Omission] - The translation omits the phrase ""亲密"", meaning ""intimate"" or ""close"". While the translation conveys the general idea, it loses the specific detail of the interaction being particularly affectionate.
[Minor]: [Accuracy/Mistranslation] - ""老婆遭冷落一旁"" translates more accurately to ""wife is neglected on the side"" or ""wife is sidelined,"" rather than simply ""wife is left behind."" The translation ""left behind"" doesn't capture the sense of neglect.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/incorrect name] - The translation incorrectly states ""Kim Jong-il"" when it should be ""Kim Ju-ae"" (金主爱).

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""founding of the state"" could be more precisely translated as ""founding of the army"" to reflect the context of a military parade celebrating the army's anniversary.

Linguistic  Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The translation mistranslates ""金主爱"" (Kim Ju-ae) as ""Kim Eil Jae"". This is a critical error as it misidentifies the subject of the sentence.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - ""Kim Eil Jae standing by his father, looking at him and talking to him and his father"" is grammatically awkward. It would be better phrased as ""Kim Eil Jae standing by his father, looking at and talking to him.""

Style Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The translated text contains incorrect names. ""Lee Hyun-hee"" and ""Kim Hyun-hye"" are incorrect renditions of 李雪主 and 金主爱 respectively. Furthermore, Kim Jong-il is deceased, it should be Kim Jong-Un, as he is the one who attended the event.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""chairman's desk"" does not accurately convey the meaning of 主席台, which is a reviewing stand or podium.
[Minor]: [Over-translation] - The phrase ""In an official photo taken of Kim Jong Un and his wife Lee Hyun-hee at a dinner with their daughter Kim Hyun-hye on July 7"" is repetitive. It's clear the photo was taken on July 7 during the dinner.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""C-seat"" is an awkward translation for C位 (center position). A better alternative would be ""center stage"" or ""center position"".

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""she also took the chairman's desk with Kim Jong-il"" sounds grammatically awkward. ""She also joined Kim Jong Un on the reviewing stand"" would be better.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""in the aftermath of the tragedy"" is not supported by the source text, therefore the added information is not only inaccurate but changes the context.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""Yang Yumangang"" is a mistranslation of ""郑永刚"" (Zheng Yonggang), the speaker's name. This is critical as it misidentifies the source of the information.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""Suzhou brand"" is a mistranslation of ""杉杉品牌"" (Shanshan brand). While it refers to a brand, the name is incorrect.
[Major]: [Omission] - ""西服"" (Western-style suit) is translated as ""western market"". This changes the meaning.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Yearly Celebrations"" is an awkward and somewhat incorrect rendering of ""年会"" (annual meeting/conference). ""Annual Conference"" or ""Annual Summit"" would be better.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""in the Chinese western market was as high as 37%"" is grammatically awkward. Should be ""in the Chinese Western-style suit market was as high as 37%"".

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Unnatural flow] - ""the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd China Business Future Yearly Celebrations"" is a bit clunky. It could be rephrased for better flow.

376,就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大” 。,"Just when the clothing business was in full swing, the Susuk Group began to transform, as Wu Yeonggang realized that once the market opened, Chinese brands would naturally form a tiered brand market, and that Susuk's clothes would remain in the spotlight and unlikely to become the country's national clothing for a long time.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""Susuk Group"" and ""Susuk's clothes"" should be ""Shanshan Group"" and ""Shanshan's clothes."" The name is mistranslated.
[Minor]: [Accuracy/Omission] - ""郑永刚 (Zheng Yonggang)"" is mistranslated to ""Wu Yeonggang."" Although not essential to understand the sentence, it is an inaccurate translation.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""in the spotlight"" is an unnatural way to express ""独领风骚"". A better phrase would be ""maintain its leading position"" or ""be the market leader.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - There is a slight awkwardness in ""and that Susuk's clothes would remain in the spotlight"". It should be rephrased for better flow.

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Unnatural flow] - The flow of the sentence, particularly the latter part, feels somewhat stiff and literal. Rephrasing could improve readability. For instance, ""...and that Shanshan's suits were unlikely to remain dominant and become the national attire for the long term.""

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/entity] - ""Sugi"" is a mistranslation. It should be ""Shanshan"" which is the name of the company.
[Major]: [mistranslation/sense] - ""what transformation really does"" is a vague and unnatural translation of ""到底转型做什么"". A more accurate translation would be ""what kind of transformation to undertake"" or ""what to transform into"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""specialist academics"" could be phrased better as ""experts and scholars"" for a smoother flow.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""We came to Shanghai to find out what transformation really does, we found a lot of specialist academics"" - this reads as two separate sentences joined together. A semicolon or a conjunction like ""and"" would improve the flow.

Style Errors
[Minor]: [awkward phrasing] - ""held various debates, workshops and seminars"" is a slightly repetitive and unnatural phrasing. ""Held a series of discussions and workshops"" would be more concise and stylistic.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""Suzuki"" is a mistranslation of ""杉杉"" (Shanshan), which is a company name. This error appears multiple times and completely changes the meaning.
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""Busan Institute of Thermal Energy"" is a mistranslation of ""鞍山热能院"" (Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy). This misidentifies the institution involved.
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""aluminum"" is a mistranslation of ""鞍钢配套的炭素研究所"" (Carbon Research Institute affiliated to Angang).
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""phosphates microcarbon spherical projects in the field of nitrogen and magnesium"" is a complete mistranslation of ""中间相炭微球"" (mesophase carbon microbeads). This sentence becomes nonsensical due to the numerous errors.

Terminology Errors
[Major]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""negative polar materials"" is not the best term; ""anode materials"" or ""negative electrode materials"" would be more accurate in this context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - The sentence structure ""Suzuki and Suzuki signed"" is awkward. It should be something like ""Shanshan and the Anshan Institute signed.""

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""基金E账户"" should be translated as ""Fund E-Account"" instead of ""Hedge Fund"". Hedge fund is a specific type of fund, while this seems to be a general account.
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - The sentence ""The E account of the Hedge Fund is blocked"" is completely inaccurate. The correct interpretation is ""The 'Fund E-Account' is here/available/launched"". 证监会授权开发 means ""The SEC authorized the development of..."". This phrase implies the launch or arrival of the account, not that it is blocked.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""aggregation"" might be slightly too technical for a general audience; something like ""collection"" or ""consolidation"" might be better.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [punctuation error] - There should be a colon after ""searching"" instead of a period, to introduce the source.

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - ""the SEC authorized the development of all funds under the name of investors for aggregation and searching"" sounds awkward.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The original text states that the university ranks third in ""the region"" (本地区). This is vague and could refer to Southeast Asia or a more specific region. The English translation doesn't provide sufficient context, and the assumption of ""the region among universities"" requires some interpretation. While the translation is not entirely wrong, the ambiguity of the source text is not addressed, leading to a slight loss of precision.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - Using ""centre"" (British spelling) may not be appropriate for all target audiences. American English prefers ""center"". While this doesn't affect understanding, it is a minor terminology issue.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Also, ""一件拉链帽衫"" (a zippered hoodie) is mistranslated as ""a hooded shirt"". While technically a hoodie is a shirt with a hood, the ""zippered"" aspect is lost, and a hoodie is a more specific term. Finally, ""短袖"" (short sleeves) is mistranslated as ""a pair of shorts"". This is a complete mistranslation of the clothing item.
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The text says ""送给"" (sent to/given to), which does not translate to ""I was given a pair of shorts"". It means that the speaker ended up with a short-sleeve shirt instead of a hoodie.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - ""积极配合催促快递及时退款"" is translated as ""actively help in making the returns on time,"" but the source text implies actively cooperating to urge the express delivery to process the refund in a timely manner. ""Making the returns on time"" isn't quite accurate.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The phrase ""秒杀"" refers to a flash sale or a very quick sale due to extremely low prices, not literally ""killing"" something.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While ""kill"" can be used figuratively, in this context, it's misleading.

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow] - ""99 seconds to kill"" sounds very awkward and aggressive. A better translation would focus on the speed and discount.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""flat waist 2 ft 5, maximum size 4 ft"" is too literal and lacks context. It would be more accurate to translate it in a way that indicates these are waist measurements for clothing.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""ft"" for ""尺"" (chi) is technically correct as a unit of measurement, but it's not the common unit for waist measurements in English. It should be translated to inches, or using the converted waist size in inches.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammatical errors] - ""1.79 / 80 kg wearing a slight tight waist"" is grammatically awkward. ""A person with height 1.79m and weight 80kg finds the waist slightly tight"" would be better.

[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""to loosen the waist"" can be interpreted as physically loosening the waist of a person. A more accurate translation would imply adjusting the tightness of the waistband.

Terminology Errors
[Major]: [incorrect term choice] - ""loose belt"" for ""松紧带"" is an incorrect term and changes the intended meaning.

""I bought it, I made over two hundred, so what's going on?"" gives a completely different meaning. A more accurate translation would be: ""I just bought it, and it's already up over two hundred.

[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""returned to me"" is a mistranslation. The shirt was returned BY the person, not TO the person. The correct translation should indicate the person returned the shirt and now wants to reorder it but the price has increased.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""shirt"" for ""体恤衫"" is a possible but slightly less precise translation. ""T-shirt"" would be a more accurate and common term.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""not the secondary product was the old product"" is an awkward and unclear rendering of ""不是次品就是旧品"". It implies that the product is definitively not a secondary product, and instead an old product. The original sentence implies that it's *either* a defective product *or* a used product.
[Minor]: [mistranslation/omission] - ""as will be shown later on"" is a slightly too literal and stylistically awkward translation of ""稍后上图"". While not incorrect, it misses the nuance that the speaker will be *uploading* or *posting* images.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""secondary product"" is not the most natural way to express the idea of a 'defective product' or 'reject product' in this context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/word order] - ""there was wear in several other places"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit awkward. ""Several other places also showed wear"" would be more natural.

Style Errors
[Major]: [awkward expressions] - The phrase ""When I actually received the product, I was stunned"" is grammatically correct but reads somewhat stiffly and less naturally than, say, ""I was shocked when I received the product"".

[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""不足"" here refers to a shortcoming or downside, not a quantity of something not being enough. The translation misses the negative connotation. The entire sentence has been mistranslated as a result.
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""没有卡"" means ""does not come with a card"" or ""does not include a card"". The translation misinterprets this as a statement about someone lacking a card.
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The phrase “自己买的” suggests that the card was purchased separately, whereas the translation does not adequately capture this. The entire sentence becomes nonsensical as a result.
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""以前在亚马逊买过手机"" indicates a previous purchase of a phone on Amazon, implying a past experience or potentially a reason for the current statement. The translation is too literal and does not convey this implied relationship.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Mobile phone"" could be better phrased as simply ""phone"" in this context for better flow.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Major]: [Grammar] - The sentence structure is awkward and unnatural. The use of ""and"" to connect the clauses makes the translation seem like a disjointed list of unrelated facts.

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow] - The overall flow is unnatural and disjointed. The connections between the clauses are unclear.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""机油"" is more commonly translated as ""engine oil"" rather than ""synthetic oil"" even though it refers to synthetic blends of engine oil.

[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""胜牌"" seems to be mistranslated as ""the winning cards."" The user is supporting brands, not cards.

Terminology Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""8c worm delivery at 8cm worm"" is confusing and doesn't properly convey the issue. The original text implies that someone ordered a 14cm worm toy but received an 8cm toy instead.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""8c=14cm, 8cm=2c"" This part is also confusing and doesn't accurately reflect the size difference issue. The units ""c"" is undefined in the translation, where in the original is an abbreviation of centimeters.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""worm"" instead of ""caterpillar"" to translate 毛毛虫 is technically not incorrect, but ""caterpillar"" would be a more precise translation as it refers to a specific type of larva.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - ""the same goods returned to China I discovered only 8 cm"" should be ""I only received an item with a size of 8cm"". The current translation implies the goods were the same but the size was different upon arrival in China. This significantly alters the meaning.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: Incorrect term choice - ""Amazon sale"" should be ""Amazon's after-sales service policy"" or ""Amazon's return policy"". ""sale"" is far too general.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Major]: Grammar - ""and at that time thought it was a trap"" is grammatically awkward. A better phrasing would be ""and at that time I suspected it was a trap.""

Style Errors
[Major]: Unnatural flow - The sentence ""I initially bought the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c and at that time thought it was a trap, so I called the Japanese Chinese customer service and clearly told them the 8 was 8c"" is too long and convoluted. Breaking it up would improve readability.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""I have shoes, I've been paid 2000 yen for them"" is a mistranslation and includes unnecessary addition. The source text indicates that the user chose option 2, was compensated 2000 yen. The ""I have shoes"" is not present in the source text, and the sentence implies they were paid *for* shoes, not compensated for a loss.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""caterpillar pages"" is a mistranslation. It should likely be translated to adult content or other pages with mature themes. It seems like this is slang.
[Minor]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""I said"" is an over-translation, implying a direct quote when the original Chinese text doesn't necessarily convey that. It can be removed without impacting the core meaning.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Japanese code"" could be more precisely translated to a more common term for that kind of code.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [linguistic convention/grammar] - The sentence ""but have you seen other caterpillar pages?"" could be punctuated better, possibly with an exclamation mark or a question mark depending on the intended tone.

571,怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。,I suspect 2 packs in the same pack of the same quality.,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - The original sentence expresses suspicion that two packs within the same box might have different qualities. The translation ""I suspect 2 packs in the same pack of the same quality"" doesn't make sense, as it speaks of 'the same pack' twice and implies that the two packs are of the same quality.
[Major]: Omission - The translation missed the fact that it is quality that varies between the two packs.

Terminology Errors
[No error]: None

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Grammar - The phrase ""the same pack of the same quality"" is grammatically awkward and unclear. It should be rephrased for better clarity.

573,希望重视包裹的运输保护,We want to protect the transport of parcels.,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Incorrect meaning] - The translation ""We want to protect the transport of parcels"" misses the nuance of ""hope/wish"" (希望) and implies an active role in protecting the parcels during transport, whereas the source text suggests a desire for the transport to be protective of the parcels. A better translation would be ""We hope you pay attention to protecting the parcels during transport"" or ""We hope you emphasize the protection of parcels during transport.""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - Using ""transport"" instead of ""transportation"" isn't technically incorrect, but less common and a bit less natural in this context.

[Major]: [mistranslation/lexical] - ""卡盒"" translated as ""cartons"". This refers to card boxes or card cases.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""cartons"" is not the most precise term for ""卡盒"" in this context, ""card boxes"" or ""card cases"" would be better.

It should be translated as ""so I am not very brave to buy something from Amazon"" or ""so I would be reluctant to buy something from Amazon""

Terminology Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The source text refers to the price being higher ""国内贵一半"" meaning ""half the price higher domestically"" or ""50% more expensive domestically"", but the translation states ""half the price in India"". This reverses the meaning and misattributes the location of the cheaper price to India.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""有保障点"" translates to ""with some guarantee/assurance"". ""Some kind of security"" is a looser translation and does not accurately capture the nuance of having a guarantee or assurance of quality/safety.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""有保障点"" can be translated better depending on the context. ""assurance"" or ""guarantee"" can be a better term instead of ""security.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""It is better to pay half the price in India with some kind of security."" reads a little unnatural. A smoother phrasing could be ""I'd rather pay more domestically, for the assurance of quality.""

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""19 years ago"" is a mistranslation of ""到现在19年"", which means ""up to 2019"" or ""until 2019"". It misrepresents the timeline being discussed. The correct expression should reflect the range from 2016 to 2019, not ""19 years ago.""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""blog"" is not necessarily the accurate term for ""评论"" (comment). While a comment can appear on a blog, it also appears in shopping sites, reviews sites and other formats. ""Comments"" could have been a more general translation

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""as I read on this blog"" is a little awkward and unnatural. A more natural phrasing might be ""as I saw in the comments.""

[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""Japan's JD.com and TCL"" is a mistranslation of ""国内的京东、天猫"". 京东 (JD.com) and 天猫 (Tmall) are both Chinese e-commerce platforms, not Japanese companies like TCL.
[Minor]: [Omission] - The word ""这一块"" (this aspect/area) is not directly translated, though its meaning is implied.

The ""State Administration of Industry and Trade"" has been reorganized into the ""State Administration for Market Regulation.""

A more accurate, context-agnostic translation would be ""Is it broken?"" or ""Something's wrong.""

[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""a very rushed odor"" is a mistranslation of ""非常冲的味道"" which should be ""a very pungent/strong smell"". ""Rushed"" doesn't make sense in this context.

Terminology Errors

[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - Using ""hair salon"" is acceptable, but ""hairdresser's"" or ""beauty salon"" might be slightly more natural depending on the intended audience and context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""The memory of the smell..."" is grammatically awkward. It sounds unnatural and could be improved.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation/omission] - ""three-piece"" is an incorrect translation of ""三体全集"" which refers to the ""Three-Body Problem"" trilogy. The translation omits the title of the book series.
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - The phrase ""the 99 yuan gift"" is awkwardly phrased and could be interpreted in multiple ways. It's not clear that the ""99 yuan"" refers to the minimum purchase amount required.
[Minor]: [mistranslation/unspecified] - The word ""shipment"" is used to translate “收到货”, however, a more appropriate word here is “package” or “delivery”.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [incorrect term choice] - ""三体全集"" should be consistently translated as ""The Three-Body Problem"" trilogy, or ""The Complete Three-Body Problem"" for clarity.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""用完商品的感受"" is mistranslated as ""I use up the product"". It should be ""after using the product"" or ""my experience with the product"".
[Minor]: [mistranslation] - ""一擦就掉了"" is translated as ""it will just fall"". More accurately it means it will ""wipe off"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""stimulant taste"" is not the most natural way to describe the smell. It would be better to say ""irritating smell"" or ""chemical smell"".

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""back teeth smooth"" should be ""teeth feel smooth"". The original sentence ""用后牙齿爽滑"" indicates the teeth feel smooth after use, not literally the back teeth are smooth.
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - ""some secondhand Oriental"" should be ""a certain second-hand e-commerce platform like JD.com"". 某二手东 refers to a specific, well-known e-commerce platform that sells used goods (and new goods as well). While not strictly wrong, ""secondhand Oriental"" is a very strange phrasing and misses the reference.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""cream with granules"" could be more accurately translated as ""paste with particles"". ""Paste"" is more common in the context of toothpaste or similar products.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""I do not know where they are being sold in bulk"" is grammatically correct, but sounds a bit awkward. A more natural phrasing might be ""I don't know where they get them in bulk"" or ""I don't know where they are wholesaling these from"".

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""should be the source of"" is a mistranslation of ""也应该对得起"" which means ""should be worthy of"". The translation completely changes the meaning of the sentence.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""medieval documents"" is a possible, but not optimal, translation of ""中古文献资料"". ""Medieval"" can work, but ""historical"" or ""ancient"" might be more appropriate depending on the specific context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The word ""source"" does not logically fit into the sentence's construction.

Style Errors
[Major]: [awkward expressions] - ""Even if this is not a professional map, even if it is a small illustration, it should be the source of the vast, medieval documents left by our ancestors!"" is awkward and doesn't flow well.

[Major]: [Over-translation] - ""这样的 (zhè yàng de)"" translates to ""this kind of"" or ""such a."" The translation is slightly over-specific by using ""this kind of governance.""

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation/incorrect meaning] - ""叶神狗血"" is mistranslated as ""killed by a dog named 'Yeshan'"". This completely changes the meaning. It actually means ""Ye Shen's ridiculous/over-the-top actions"".
[Major]: [mistranslation/omission] - ""公会之间勾心斗角"" is translated as ""war between the two communists"". This is a severe mistranslation. It should be translated as something like ""intrigue/scheming between guilds"".
[Minor]: [omission] - ""按着这个剧情来说"" is translated to ""According to this story"". While not strictly wrong, it could be improved to something like ""Based on the plot/story"".

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [incorrect term choice] - ""communists"" is an incorrect and inappropriate term. It should be ""guilds.""
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Internet"" should probably be ""online game"" or ""virtual world"" for better context.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/word choice] - ""a more relaxed and enjoyable"" is slightly awkward. ""more relaxed and enjoyable"" or ""quite relaxed and enjoyable"" would sound better.

[Major]: [Mistranslation/Omission] - ""Chong Jun Hsu"" should be ""Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu"". The translation appears to have combined and mistranslated these two names into one.
[Minor]: [Mistranslation/Word Choice] - ""electronic essay"" should be ""e-sports novel"" for better context.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation/omission] - ""而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病"" is mistranslated and omits important details. It should convey that in terms of romantic relationships, the novel ""The King's Avatar"" (全职) avoids the common tropes of harems with countless beauties, or being either overtly romantic or based on BL content, which are often criticised in online novels. The translation ""And in emotional terms, there's not a single piece of work, and there's no general network, either beautiful or rotten,"" completely misses the core meaning. The original text refers to features common in online novels (harems, focus on beauty, or BL elements), which ""The King's Avatar"" avoids. ""The King's Avatar"" is a novel itself, so it can't be ""not a single piece of work."" The reference to ""general network"" is nonsensical.
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""they love to glorify the game"" is an oversimplification of ""他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏"". It doesn't fully capture the essence of their passion for the game ""Glory"" which is the name of the game, not just the abstract concept of glory. ""They love the game Glory"" is a better translation.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Glory"" is not translated directly, but the meaning implies ""the game"". While this is understandable, in the context of this novel, ""Glory"" is the name of the game, thus it should be a proper noun.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/word order] - ""all of the people's feelings"" could be smoother. ""All the characters' feelings"" or ""the feelings of all the characters"" would be better.

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The whole translation is somewhat awkward and doesn't flow naturally. It sounds like a very literal machine translation.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""The small measures"" is an over-translation of ""小计量"". A more accurate translation would be ""small schemes"" or ""petty tricks"".

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [incorrect term choice] - ""plots"" is not the best translation of ""阴谋"". The word ""plots"" generally has a negative connotation suggesting something potentially harmful or dangerous. However, the original Chinese text implies more a light-hearted scheme or trick. A better translation could be ""schemes"" or ""plans"" depending on context.

Linguistic Convention Errors

650,个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。,"In the first place, the book is inexpensive; it is more than 700 pages, and it is even better in book form to have a double printing; the second is that in contrast to Michelangelo's whole work, in which the painting is the main subject, the Da Vinci manuscript is mostly in black and white, which is best value for money for the non-artistic reader to appreciate both the painting and the manuscript.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""double printing"" is not accurate. The original text says ""分成两本"", which means split into two volumes, not ""double printing"".
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""whole work"" is a bit too strong. The original text just refers to ""米开朗基罗全集那本"", meaning ""that Michelangelo complete collection"".

651,2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。,"2.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""shade parts of the county are too deep"" is a mistranslation. The Chinese text refers to ""阴影部分"" (shadowed parts) being too dark, not specific regions or ""county"".
[Minor]: [omission] - ""a little unfortunately"" should be ""a little unfortunate"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""drafts"" is a technically correct translation of ""草稿"", but ""sketches"" or ""preliminary drawings"" might be a more natural fit in this context.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""not see details"" should be ""cannot see details"" or ""can't see details"".

Style Errors
[Minor]: [awkward phrasing] - ""The description of the painting part is great"" could be smoother, e.g., ""The descriptions of the paintings are excellent"".

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""Da Vinci code"" is an incorrect translation of ""达芬奇的手稿"" which means Da Vinci's manuscripts.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - The term ""richer"" is subjective. While not strictly incorrect, using a more precise word relating to the *variety* or *volume* of the manuscripts would be more accurate.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Punctuation errors] - Using ""And third,"" is slightly awkward. A smoother transition would be better.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容"" means that the latter's wide range of knowledge and high level of achievement goes beyond what can be described as a genius, not that they are ""too ambitious"".
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""too ambitious and high in achievement"" should be ""breadth of knowledge and achievement"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""ambitious"" doesn't fit the context. A better term would be ""breadth"".

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""the manuscript has no language at all"" is a complete misinterpretation of the Chinese phrase ""彻底没语言了"". The original meaning is closer to ""completely speechless"" or ""utterly beyond words"" in terms of amazement.
[Major]: [over-translation] - The phrase ""half of a da Vinci"" is not directly present in the source, it attempts to represent the limited understanding gained from only seeing the paintings. While it's not entirely wrong, it makes the sentence more complex than necessary and misses the direct implication.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - The term ""drawing"" is used but the Chinese word ""画作"" generally refers to paintings or artworks.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The sentence structure ""When you see a drawing and only half of a da Vinci"" is grammatically awkward.

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The entire translation sounds unnatural and doesn't effectively convey the awe and wonder expressed in the original Chinese.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - The phrase ""敬请期待"" is translated as ""downloading them forever"". A more accurate translation would be something along the lines of ""stay tuned"" or ""coming soon,"" reflecting the idea of anticipation rather than an infinite download loop.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""after a ticket"" is a mistranslation of ""万一跳票"". ""跳票"" in this context means the book release is delayed or cancelled, not that a ""ticket"" is involved. A better translation would be ""in case of delays"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""download a blank book"" is technically accurate, but stylistically a bit odd. ""Receive an empty file"" might be more appropriate.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar mistakes] - The sentence ""books that are pre-ordered should not be bought anymore"" sounds slightly awkward. It could be improved by rephrasing to something like ""I won't pre-order books anymore"".

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The phrase ""download a blank book after a ticket"" (referring back to the ""ticket"" mistake) is very unnatural in English.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - The sentence ""and then it got kind of dark when I read it"" is a complete mistranslation of the original meaning. The original text is expressing that the user is writing some afterthoughts or a brief review based on their memory of having read the text a long time ago, after encountering it again recently. The mistranslation makes no sense in context.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Read it a long time ago"" could be slightly improved to ""I read it a long time ago"" for better flow.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The phrase ""just happened to see it by memory"" is grammatically awkward. It would be more natural to say ""just happened to see it, writing from memory"" or ""just happened to see it, so I'm writing some thoughts based on my memory"".

690,我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。,"I think the novella, as well as the title, is a kind of acting art, the author wants to convey that love is more than just the parting on stage and the sea of urban legends, not only that the love of me is like paint, love is not only above and should not be represented above, love is also life is bland like water, dull tasteless day after day, there are also the speechlessness of life, the escape from reality, the restlessness of the future.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""the parting on stage and the sea of urban legends"" is an overly literal translation of ""舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂"". While ""悲欢离合"" can be translated as ""parting,"" in this context, it refers more broadly to the joys and sorrows of life or relationships. Also ""sea of urban legends"" is not a natural translation of ""海枯石烂“， and is too literal.
[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""the love of me is like paint"" is not a natural translation of ""你侬我侬的如胶似漆"". While the literal meaning is close, the phrase ""like paint"" does not convey the intended meaning of being deeply in love and inseparable. A better translation would be ""being deeply in love"" or ""being inseparable.""
[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""there are also the speechlessness of life, the escape from reality, the restlessness of the future."" - ""the speechlessness of life"" is an awkward translation of ""对生活的无措"". A more accurate translation would be ""the helplessness towards life"". ""the restlessness of the future"" is an awkward translation of ""未来的茫然"". A more accurate translation would be ""the uncertainty of the future"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""novella"" should be ""collection of short stories"" because of the Chinese text ""小说集“.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""love is not only above and should not be represented above"" - awkward phrasing; rephrase to ""love is not just the above and shouldn't be represented only by the above"" or similar.

Style Errors
[Major]: [awkward expressions] - The entire translation suffers from a stiff and unnatural flow, typical of machine translations. Needs significant rewriting for clarity and fluency.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""broken marriage"" is not accurate. The original text refers to ""索然无味的婚姻"", which means a boring or tasteless marriage.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""This is why I don't recommend reading"" should be ""This is precisely why I don't recommend *this* book"". The translation misses that the recommendation is about the specific book, not reading in general.
[Minor]: [Over-translation] - ""surprising"" isn't the best translation for ""惊涛骇浪"" in this context. While literally ""surprising,"" it more figuratively means ""tumultuous"" or ""eventful.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - ""the feel of the book will be strange and boring"" sounds a bit awkward. ""The reading experience"" or ""you will find the book"" would be better.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""Marx's cholera-ridden love triangle"" is a mistranslation. The original text mentions ""马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》"", which is Gabriel García Márquez's novel ""Love in the Time of Cholera"". The translation incorrectly associates Marx with the novel and creates a ""love triangle"" where none exists in the original text.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [punctuation] - The question mark at the end of the sentence ""such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?"" is grammatically correct, but stylistically the sentence could be improved for flow by using a colon to introduce the example rather than ""such as"".

Style Errors
[Minor]: [awkward phrasing] - ""the daily episodes don't illuminate or expand a person's thoughts or perspective"" is a bit awkward. It could be phrased more naturally, such as ""the daily episodes don't offer any profound insights or expand one's perspective.""

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - The phrase ""不能细看"" which literally translates to ""cannot look closely"" or ""cannot examine closely"" is a metaphor for lacking depth or being flawed upon scrutiny. The translation misses this nuance by interpreting ""look at"" literally rather than as ""analyze"" or ""scrutinize"".

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/inaccuracy] - ""Alipay and WeChat hadn't mentioned that they had borrowed a subsidy to cultivate the habit of using the Great War"" is a mistranslation. It should be something along the lines of ""Alipay and WeChat hadn't yet engaged in subsidy wars to cultivate user habits."" The original text refers to Alipay and WeChat using subsidies to compete for users and create habits, not that they literally ""borrowed a subsidy"" or referred to ""the Great War.""
[Major]: [mistranslation/inaccuracy] - ""but the share of third-party payments today was so small that it's not mentioned in the book."" is also incorrect.

The Chinese phrase suggests the businesses are avoiding using UnionPay because of high transaction fees, not necessarily that the ""cashflow"" is too high. It is also a misinterpretation of the reason, it is not just about the absolute cash flow, it is about transaction fees associated with high volume of transactions.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""cashflow"" is not entirely wrong, but a more accurate and natural term here would be ""transaction fees"" or simply ""fees"".

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""This is the time when many people..."" could be slightly improved to ""These days, many people..."" or ""Now, many people..."" for better flow.

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The connection between ""go out to eat with their mobile phones"" and ""businesses have abandoned the bank"" is somewhat abrupt and not naturally flowing. A better phrasing would clarify the connection (e.g., ""businesses have abandoned accepting UnionPay"").

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""写高大空"" (xie gao da kong) is an idiom, which refers to writing that is grandiose, unrealistic, and detached from reality. The translation ""big and tall"" is a literal interpretation but misses the intended meaning.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""通俗易懂"" (tong su yi dong) means ""easy to understand,"" but carries the connotation of being ""plain language"" or ""accessible."" The translation ""common language"" is too literal and doesn't fully convey the meaning of easy to understand.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""common language"" instead of something like ""plain language,"" ""simple terms,"" or ""easily understandable language"" is less accurate to the meaning of ""通俗易懂""

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [omission] - The translation omits the nuance of ""默默放在心里"", which implies a deeper level of internalizing feelings rather than simply not expressing them. A more accurate translation would convey the idea of keeping these feelings deeply cherished and unexpressed within the heart.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - The phrase ""love you"" is a mistranslation. The meaning is closer to being affectionate. It doesn't have to be romantic love.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""even with love, gratitude and appreciation, but they do not express it silently."" The sentence is grammatically awkward and could be phrased more clearly.

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow] - The phrase ""it is difficult to express that they love you"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better flow. A more natural way to phrase this might be ""most people find it difficult to express their affection"".

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Addition] - The word ""dismissals"" is incorrect. The original Chinese text refers to ""辞职率"", which translates to ""turnover rate"" or ""resignation rate"". While dismissals can contribute to turnover, the sentence specifically refers to employees voluntarily leaving (resigning), not being dismissed.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Appreciate"" is a bit weak. While not incorrect, something like ""recognize value"" or ""show appreciation"" might be slightly more nuanced and appropriate in a business context related to employee retention.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar/Word order] - ""They learn to appreciate"" is grammatically correct, but stylistically it would be better to say ""By learning to appreciate"" or ""When companies learn to appreciate"". This improves the flow and causality.

Style Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""Middle and West"" does not accurately represent ""中西方"" (Chinese and Western). A more accurate translation would be ""Chinese and Western cultures."" This significantly alters the meaning.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""more will be harvested, if the chance to see the original text of the author is believed"" is a very awkward and inaccurate rendering of ""相信会收获更多"" (believe will harvest more). It should be something like ""you will likely gain more"" or ""you would likely gain more"" or ""you would benefit more."" Also, ""if the chance to see..."" is too literal. ""If you have the chance to read..."" would be better. It also lacks a conditional.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""harvest"" is not the best term to use for ""收获"" in this context. ""Gain"" or ""benefit"" would be more appropriate.

[Major]: [mistranslation/sense] - ""tell-tale sign"" is an awkward translation for ""指示灯"" in this context. A better translation would be ""indicator light"" or ""charging light"".
[Major]: [mistranslation/sense] - ""is also generous"" translates ""也是施舍"" which means something closer to ""is treated like a charity case"" or ""is given handouts."" ""Generous"" implies the customer is being generous, not that Panasonic is treating the customer as someone receiving charity.
[Minor]: [omission] - ""电源"" is translated as ""power instructions"". It would be more accurate to say ""power indicator"".

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""A very strong smell"" is a bit awkward. It would be more natural to say ""There's a very strong smell"" or ""It has a very strong smell"".

Terminology Errors

The scope of the office and house are conflated and potentially misleading.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""You can return a product"" is a mistranslation of ""申请退货时才告知"". It should be translated as ""They only told me when I applied for a return...""
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""checked in"" is a mistranslation of “签收”, it means to sign for/receipt/acceptance.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/entity] - ""Jindong"" should be ""JD.com"" to maintain consistency with the original source and be understandable to the target audience.
[Major]: [mistranslation/sense] - The sentence ""the customer service of Jindong was just too big, so the customer service gave it back after opening it"" is nonsensical and unclear. It should convey that the customer service at JD.com allowed a return even after the diapers were opened due to a strong odor.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Paper diapers"" is acceptable, but ""diapers"" is more common and natural.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/word order] - ""I have bought non-refundable items, including milk, paper diapers and so on, and the customer service gave them back"" could be improved for better flow and clarity.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - The first part of the sentence ""告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来"" is mistranslated. It should be ""I was told that either I take it myself, or let the delivery person buy it."" The translation ""I'll either get it myself, or get a courier to buy it for me"" misses the crucial context that someone TOLD the speaker this option.
[Minor]: Addition - The phrase ""it's not easy"" appears to be an addition, adding an emotional layer that is not directly present in the original. This is subjective though, as the implied difficulty is present.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: Incorrect term choice - Using ""courier"" instead of ""delivery person"". ""派送员"" is more directly translated as delivery person, and using the word courier changes the tone slightly.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Linguistic Conventions/Grammar - ""why do I give people money to buy things that I don't buy?"" could be stylistically improved, though it is understandable. A better phrasing might be ""why should I make them pay for something I didn't order?""

Style Errors
[Major]: Unnatural flow - The flow of the sentence is somewhat unnatural, especially the phrase ""it's not easy, why do I give people money to buy things that I don't buy?"". It sounds awkward in English.

[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感"" translated as ""but the head is not good, but a box is basically soft, look is not visible, if you feel it"" - the translation reverses the meaning of ""个头还不错"" (good size) to ""the head is not good"". Also, ""要手感"" (it requires feeling) is mistranslated as ""if you feel it"".
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""好坏参着卖的"" translated as ""badly sold"" - The original sentence refers to selling good and bad ones mixed together, not selling badly.
[Major]: [omission] - The phrase ""都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧"" (Dole brand shouldn't be too bad) is not fully represented, only inferred.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""个头"" (size) translated as ""head"". Although context might suggest ""head"" in some cases, ""size"" would be a more appropriate term.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""received in the future to see the packaging felt it was fine"" should be ""After receiving and seeing the packaging, it felt fine"".

[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""吃一堑长一智"" translates to ""A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit."" or ""Learn from your mistakes."" ""Eat your heart out"" has a completely different meaning.
[Major]: [over-translation] - The translation adds ""never"" when the original Chinese simply expresses the intention to not buy fruit online again.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""online stores"" is acceptable, but ""e-commerce"" would be a more appropriate term in this context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [punctuation errors] - The sentence should end with a period instead of an exclamation point, since it's a statement of experience, not an exclamation.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""From the outside of the packaging bag, the degree to which it is hard to feel is disturbing"" doesn't make sense. It seems to be trying to convey the degree of damage or wear on the packaging is concerning.
[Major]: [mistranslation/omission] - ""瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的"" (A corner of the bottom of the bottle is severely dented, which must have been caused by a strong impact) is missing from the translation.
[Minor]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""there is an opening that is almost non-sticky"" implies there is an opening. This is likely intended to describe the lack of a tight seal, but the translation makes it sound like the opening is not sticky. The intention is that there's little or no stickiness implying a compromised seal.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""the first result was only 2 copies, after multiple communication, it was confirmed that it was a missed, I had to make a return"" should be ""the first time I requested 3, only 2 were sent. After communicating, it was confirmed to be a missed shipment, and they promised to resend the missing one"". The phrase ""I had to make a return"" is inaccurate. The original text implies a promise to resend the missing voucher, not a return of the received ones.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""copies"" might be better as ""vouchers"" or ""items"" for clarity, though ""copies"" isn't strictly wrong.

Linguistic Convention Errors

[Minor]: Mistranslation - ""亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的"" is translated as ""Amazon abroad to get to domestic clearance is still very strong"".

[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""go to the car"" is a slightly awkward way to phrase it. It should be ""transfer onto the car"" or ""end up on the car"".

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""the sense of a bit of overlap"" is a slightly awkward and unclear rendering of ""感觉有点敷衍"" which conveys a feeling of perfunctoriness or being handled carelessly.

[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - The term ""debilitating"" implies physical or mental impairment, which isn't necessarily the core meaning of ""郁闷.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[No Error]

Style Errors
[Major]: Unnatural flow - ""The experience was debilitating"" sounds overly formal and clinical for a common expression of feeling down. A more natural translation would capture the everyday usage of ""郁闷.""

815,之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。,"The filter works well, after 28 days, one or two days later the water is still free of scale.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Mistranslation/Omission] - ""之前在别家网购的滤芯"" is translated as ""The filter works well"". The original sentence is talking about a filter bought online from another store, not the current one being discussed. While the filter's functionality is mentioned later, this leading phrase is omitted here.
[Minor]: [Accuracy/Over-translation] - ""...one or two days later the water is still free of scale"" - The word ""still"" implies that the water was free of scale before. It should just be ""the water is free of scale"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Terminology/Incorrect term choice] - ""scale"" might be more accurately described as ""limescale"" or ""mineral buildup"" depending on context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Linguistic Conventions/Grammar] - ""The filter works well, after 28 days, one or two days later the water is still free of scale"" - awkward phrasing, using a comma unnecessarily. Better ""The filter worked well; even after 28 days plus an extra day or two, the water was still free of scale.""

816,由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~,"Since it's always been the quality of what can be purchased on Amazon, this time I wanted to buy here, for the first time in Amazon to buy a filter, it doesn't feel very good, not only the early start to water scale, and the filter has been used until the 28th day, will be floating a small black carbon powder, don't really know whether to continue to use, or to throw out the direct good, very depressed~","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/unclear] - ""Since it's always been the quality of what can be purchased on Amazon"" is grammatically awkward and doesn't quite capture the intended meaning, which is more along the lines of ""Because I've always been satisfied with the quality of items purchased on Amazon.""
[Minor]: [mistranslation/word choice] - ""water scale"" should be ""scale buildup"" or ""limescale"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""carbon powder"" could be more accurately translated as ""carbon particles"" or ""carbon dust.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/word order] - ""for the first time in Amazon to buy a filter"" is slightly awkward. It could be improved to ""This is the first time I bought a filter on Amazon"".

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow/awkward expressions] - The entire translation sounds unnatural and awkward. Several phrases, such as ""don't really know whether to continue to use, or to throw out the direct good, very depressed~"" are clunky and difficult to read smoothly.
[Minor]: [Style/overly literal] - The sentence structure is too close to the Chinese original, leading to awkward phrasing.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""it is possible to see if there is a lack of power supply to each separate unit"" is a mistranslation of ""每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示"", which means there is a lack of indication of whether each individual unit is powered. The original means that the plug board does not have an indicator light to show whether each outlet is working.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""plug boards"" could be more accurately translated as ""power strips"" or ""extension cords.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""the exterior is generally working"" should be ""the exterior build quality is generally average"" or ""the exterior workmanship is generally so-so"" for better flow.

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow] - The sentence ""but as described by the shop owner, from the ease of use, it is possible to see if there is a lack of power supply to each separate unit"" is awkwardly phrased and doesn't flow naturally.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""so it's time to check the quality of the product"" doesn't accurately convey the meaning of ""等时间来检验产品的质量"". The original Chinese implies waiting for time to reveal the product quality, suggesting a longer-term observation. The English translation sounds like an immediate quality check is intended.

Terminology Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""water filtration pump"" should be ""water filter pitcher"" or ""water filter jug"". A ""pump"" implies a mechanical device, which isn't accurate here.

[Minor]: [omission] - ""each box was marked"" is a simplification. The original text says ""每项各有盒子"" which means ""each item had its own box."" This is slightly different.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""Commissioner"" might not be the best translation for ""专员"". It depends on the context, but a more general term like ""representative"" or ""specialist"" might be more appropriate.
Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The coffee machine is described as ""残次品"" which means defective product, but the translation says ""second-hand"". While defective products can be used (second-hand) it is not a direct or best translation of the original.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""处理结果"" is best translated to outcome or resolution. The phrase ""what Amazon will do"" is too broad and can be improved.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Awkward expressions] - The sentence structure ""4 Almost 3 days later, and I still have no idea"" is a bit awkward and unnatural.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - ""soup"" instead of ""pot"". The entire text is about a cooking pot, not soup. This fundamentally misunderstands the topic.
[Major]: Mistranslation - ""baked fat burst"" should be something like ""large piece of fatty pork"". This is not a literal burst, but a large piece of fat.
[Major]: Mistranslation - ""the paste, the opening could not be opened"" should be ""it burned/stuck, and I couldn't season it properly"" or ""the seasoning failed."" ""Opening"" (开锅) refers to the seasoning process of a new wok.
[Minor]: Mistranslation - ""very easy"" should be ""very light"". 轻巧 usually refers to lightweight.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - ""seasoning"" might be a better choice than ""opening"" in the context of a cooking pot.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Grammar mistakes - ""Because it was well received, everyone was very hopeful about this soup"" is awkward. It should be something like ""Because of the good reviews, I had high expectations for this pot"".

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - The phrase ""the cups"" is used multiple times, implying multiple cups. However, the original Chinese text implies only one cup. It should be ""the cup"".

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - There is not enough information to decide if terminology errors exist.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""so let's have a good breakdown!"" is not a correct translation of ""到时候再好好折腾!"". A better translation would be ""then I'll play around with it for a while!"" or ""then I'll give it a good try!""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - While not incorrect, ""transformer"" could be more precisely translated depending on the context. However, without additional context, ""transformer"" is acceptable.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The sentence ""When I got it, I bought the transformer"" is slightly awkward. A better phrasing would be ""After receiving it, I immediately bought the transformer"" or ""As soon as I received it, I bought a transformer"".

[Major]: [Omission] - It's unclear what the subject is. It is highly likely about umbrella or another item.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Commonplace"" is a valid translation for ""一般,"" but in the context of describing a product's material, ""mediocre"" or ""average"" might be more fitting.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""bag"" is mistranslated from 底部 (bottom). The original sentence refers to the bottom of an item (likely a product, judging from the context). Also, ""eye"" is a mistranslation. 砂眼 means ""pinhole"" or ""sand hole"" in this context, which is a defect, not an actual eye. Furthermore, the last part of the sentence ""can I tell if my personality is bad?"" is a literal and nonsensical translation of ""不知道是我人品不好还是？"", which means ""I wonder if it's just my bad luck?"".

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow] - The sentence construction is awkward and unnatural in English.

904,给配送的打电话也不接。,Calls to the delivery service were not answered.,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""delivery service"" is a broader term than intended. The Chinese text refers specifically to the delivery person (the person making the delivery), not the entire service. A more accurate translation would be ""delivery person"" or ""delivery driver.""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""service"" might be too formal. A more casual and contextually appropriate term might be ""driver"" or ""person.""

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - While not strictly incorrect, using ""the delivery service"" could be slightly improved. Consider changing to ""the delivery driver"" or ""the driver"" for a smoother read.

Style Errors
[Minor]: [Awkward expressions] - ""Calls to the delivery service were not answered"" is functional but slightly stilted. ""The delivery driver wasn't answering the phone"" would be more natural.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While not strictly wrong, using ""complaint"" twice in close succession sounds awkward. Alternatives like ""place to file a complaint"" or ""way to complain"" would be slightly better.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - The second ""to complain"" is grammatically redundant and sounds unnatural.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - ""I asked for a delay in delivery, and when the delivery was not requested, the delivery was delayed"" is confusing and inaccurate. The original text indicates that the speaker *did not* request a delay, and the delivery was delayed anyway, with a message claiming it was done ""according to my request.""
[Minor]: Omission - The phrase ""这样的短信过来"" is translated as ""the messaging came,"" which is a bit vague. It could be improved to include the fact that it's a text message.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: Grammar - ""the messaging came"" is grammatically awkward. ""The message came"" would be better.

[Major]: [mistranslation/omission] - The phrase ""后面又说什么"" is mistranslated as ""What's next on"". It means ""Then they talked about/mentioned"". The translation omits the speaker and changes the focus.
[Minor]: [mistranslation/terminology] - ""中转"" is translated to ""transfer"", which is understandable, but depending on context might be better translated to ""transit"" or ""interchange"". In logistics and transport, ""transfer"" can suggest ownership or control, which may not be accurate in this case.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - As mentioned above, ""transfer"" may not be the most accurate term depending on context.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [punctuation] - The question mark could potentially be replaced with a period to reflect a statement, as the tone is not necessarily interrogative.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [incorrect term choice] - 极差 is translated to poor, a better translation will be worst.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] -  The word ""We"" should be ""I"" in this case since the source does not contain any plural pronouns.

It would be more natural to say ""$600 for this..."" or ""This is what I got for $600...""

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The phrase ""925-25"" is not properly translated. It likely refers to a specific product or item, but the translation leaves it as a literal string of numbers, which loses the meaning. This makes the latter half of the sentence incomprehensible.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Writing"" can be more accurately interpreted as ""penmanship"" or ""calligraphy"" depending on the context. This is a minor terminology issue because ""writing"" is generally understandable, but not the most precise.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""I only opened one today, but I didn't feel right."" is not accurate. The original text implies the person listened to the item (likely a speaker or headphones) and noticed an imbalance in the audio. A more accurate translation would be something like: ""... I only opened it today, and after listening to it, something didn't seem right.""

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/omission] - ""the sound"" is too vague. It should be ""that the problem was due to the song's sound effects"".
[Minor]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""distortion"" is too general. ""偏音"" is more specific and refers to unbalanced sound channels. It could be translated as ""channel imbalance"" or ""audio imbalance.""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""bass and the sound that I got before that sounded good"" is awkward and unclear. ""low-frequency effect wasn't as good as my previous ones"" would be more accurate and natural.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""is it only the purple that I bought that this phenomenon has?"" should be ""is this phenomenon only happening with the purple one that I bought?""

[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""刚入手德版的DN1080"" means ""just got the German version of DN1080"", not ""which was only available in German"". This significantly alters the meaning.

Terminology Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""the side of my transformer slipped away"" is not a correct translation of ""我的变压器那边还凹下去了"". It means ""the area near my transformer was dented"". This is a critical error because it misrepresents the nature of the defect.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""uncassage"" is not a word. ""开箱用手恢复"" translates to ""unboxed and manually restored"". While the intention of ""uncassage"" is understood in context, it is completely inaccurate and disrupts the flow.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""transformer"" might be too specific. Depending on the context, it could be a component near the transformer or a more general part.

[Minor]: [omission] - The sentence lacks clarity regarding what ""that do it"" refers to. It seems to allude to the build quality.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""machine"" is a generic term. More contextually relevant word may be ""model"" or ""device.""

Accuracy Errors

In this context, ""小马"" most likely refers to a specific company or brand name, possibly a tech company (perhaps a Chinese company with ""Ma"" in its name, like Alibaba's Jack Ma). Therefore, it's mistranslated.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""代工"" is translated as ""working in China."" The term ""代工"" implies contract manufacturing or OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing). The translation loses the core meaning of the original Chinese text.

Terminology Errors
[Major]: [Incorrect term choice] - The term ""the little horse"" is not a standard term and does not convey the intended meaning of referring to a company or brand.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - The sentence ""I feel it's better for Sony to have it working in China..."" is grammatically awkward. A better phrasing would be ""I think Sony would be better off having it manufactured in China...""

[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""two-way channel"" is a literal translation and does not make sense in English. It should be ""stereo sound"" or ""stereo system.""

Terminology Errors

Linguistic Convention Errors

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The sentence structure in the translation is somewhat unnatural. Specifically, the phrase ""The machine is heating up, the two-way channel used to watch movies is 40-50 °C for about 2 hours"" is awkward and could be written more clearly. For example, ""The device heats up a lot. After watching a two-hour movie in stereo, the top cover reaches 40-50°C.""

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""Entrepreneurship"" is too narrow a translation for ""企业精神"" which means ""enterprise spirit"" or ""company ethos"". While ""entrepreneurship"" is related, it emphasizes starting a business, whereas the Chinese term is broader.
[Minor]: [over-translation] - ""Business mission"" is too narrow a translation for ""企业使命"", which is better translated as ""company mission"" or ""enterprise mission"". ""Business"" can refer to a specific transaction or department.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""拆开"" should be translated to ""disassemble"" or ""take apart"" in the context of something like a gadget, not ""take it off."" This changes the meaning slightly, making it sound like something was physically attached and removed, rather than taken apart into its constituent pieces.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - The last part, ""用着就不爽了"" is translated as ""you're not happy with it."" While not incorrect, this misses the nuanced meaning of ""not as enjoyable to use."" It's not about general unhappiness, but about the degraded user experience after reassembly.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [incorrect term choice] - The translation uses the word ""mistake"" where ""waste"" would be more appropriate. The Chinese word ""冤"" in this context implies a sense of being unjustly wasted, so translating to ""mistake"" doesn't fully capture the intended meaning.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammatical error] - ""If it's satisfying when you take it off,"" sounds awkward. A better phrasing would be ""If I'm satisfied after taking it apart"".

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The phrase ""it's hard to put it back together again"" feels somewhat redundant. Shortening it to ""it's hard to reassemble"" or ""it's hard to put back together"" would improve the flow.
[Minor]: [awkward expressions] - The repetition of ""take it apart/off"" and the somewhat stilted sentence structure make the translation sound unnatural.

[Minor]: [over-translation] - The phrase ""好嘛"" is translated as ""well"", which adds little meaning in this context and could be considered slightly over-translated.

984,买后订单显示，预计20号送达，于是家里人在家等了三天！,"The order came in and the delivery was scheduled for the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Over-translation] - ""The order came in"" is an over-translation of ""买后订单显示"", which literally translates to ""After purchase, the order showed."" The English makes it sound like the order physically arrived. A more accurate rendering would be, ""After making the purchase, the order details showed..."" or ""After purchasing, the order indicated...""
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Temporal] - The phrase ""waited at home for three days!"" is an exaggeration. The order was expected on the 20th, and the family waited three days *around* that date, not necessarily *after* that date. The waiting likely started before the 20th, or the day of, but not for *three days* AFTER. The original phrase doesn't specify the precise timing, only that the expectation of delivery around the 20th led to a three-day wait.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Scheduled"" could be improved. The word ""estimated"" or ""projected"" would more closely align to the ""预计"" which conveys more of a prediction than a rigid scheduling.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Punctuation errors] - The use of an exclamation point at the end (""three days!"") is not necessary and adds unnecessary emphasis.

Style Errors
[Major]: [Awkward expressions] - ""The order came in"" is a somewhat unnatural expression in this context. The rephrasing mentioned in the accuracy errors would resolve this.

However, in the evening, without receiving any calls or SMS, Cha Cha Logistics was finally received at noon, and the signage was also displayed.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""准备开开心心收货"" translates to ""ready to happily receive the package"". The translation ""ready for a party and a reception"" is a mistranslation and significantly alters the meaning.
[Minor]: [Omission] - ""查物流"" is translated as ""Cha Cha Logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou"". It should be ""checked the logistics"". The check action is missed.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""竟然中午就被签收了，还显示的本人签收！"" translates to ""surprisingly it was signed for at noon and it was displayed as signed by myself!"". The translated sentence ""Cha Cha Logistics was finally received at noon, and the signage was also displayed"" misses the surprise of the package being signed for and mistranslates ""本人签收"" (signed by myself) to ""the signage was also displayed""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""Cha Cha Logistics"" sounds odd. It is better to keep it as ""logistics information"" or ""delivery information"".

989,简直怀疑人生了好么！,This is why I am so worried about the consequences of my behavior.,"MQM annotations:

[Critical]: [mistranslation] - The Chinese sentence ""简直怀疑人生了好么！"" expresses a feeling of disbelief or questioning one's life, similar to ""This makes me question my life!"" or ""I'm starting to doubt my existence!"". The provided translation, ""This is why I am so worried about the consequences of my behavior,"" completely misses this meaning and conveys a sense of worry about consequences, which is unrelated to the original sentiment.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation/omission] - The phrase ""送来成这个样子"" is not adequately translated. While ""Not only that the cylinders are open"" gets part of the meaning, the initial sense of ""arriving in this condition/state"" is missing, impacting the overall understanding of the initial complaint. The cylinders are likely referring to the packaging, but context is not clear in the translation. It should be something like: ""Delivered like this...""
[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""re-packaging"" may not be the most accurate translation of ""调包"". ""调包"" implies switching out the contents, not just re-packaging. ""Switching out the contents"" or ""if the contents have been switched"" would be closer.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""electricity package"" is awkward. ""Electronics package"" or ""electrical appliance packaging"" would be better.

The translation adds ""machines"" which is not necessarily implied, but not incorrect as the content is about machine.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - There are no specific terminology errors, but the use of ""machines"" as described above does not fully capture the intended meaning.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""This year, it is almost the top electricity"" is a completely incorrect rendering of ""差不多顶级电动了"". It should be something like ""It's almost the top electric toothbrush"". This introduces a critical comprehension error.
[Minor]: [Over-translation] - ""brushing modes"" is a bit redundant. ""Cleaning modes"" or simply ""modes"" would be more natural in the context of electric toothbrushes.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""electricity"" should be ""electric toothbrush"".

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - ""change to a different one daily"" is grammatically correct, but sounds slightly unnatural. ""Change to a different mode every day"" would be better.

The current translation, while technically correct, implies a more aggressive tone than is necessarily present in the original.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - In the Chinese context, ""追责"" implies seeking accountability through formal channels, potentially involving reporting or filing a complaint.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - ""10.5 wide bars, 7.5 W"" is nonsensical. It should be something like ""ordered size 7.5W"". ""bars"" is a complete mistranslation.
[Minor]: Mistranslation - ""The shoe size is slightly larger"" is not as accurate as ""The shoe size runs a little large""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - ""upper legs"" is an odd way to describe how the shoe feels when worn. ""On the foot"" or ""when worn"" would be better.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Grammar - ""...and have a pair of shoes in order"" is grammatically incorrect. It should be ""and putting in a pair of insoles fixes it"".

Style Errors
[Major]: Unnatural flow - The phrasing ""25 feet long, 10.5 wide bars, 7.5 W"" is unnatural and confusing, compounding the accuracy error. It doesn't flow well.
[Minor]: Awkward expressions - ""I usually like to wear them loose"" could be more elegantly phrased as ""I usually prefer a looser fit"".

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""bad taste control"" is a mistranslation of ""品控真的不敢恭维"" which means the quality control is not good, not something about ""bad taste"".
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""one toe is broken"" is a mistranslation of ""一只鞋底胶有破损"" which means the glue on the sole of one shoe is damaged.
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""a knob"" is a mistranslation of ""有个针眼"" which means there is a pinhole.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""toe and the sole have gotten in the wrong place"" is a mistranslation of ""鞋面与鞋底连接处胶条错位"" which means the glue strip connecting the upper and the sole is misaligned.
[Major]: [over-translation] - ""and everything has been well done"" is an over-translation of ""明摆着的以次充好"" which means obviously selling substandard products as good ones.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""toe"" instead of ""sole"" to describe the bottom of the shoe.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""this shoe is a bit of a bad taste control"" is grammatically incorrect. It should be ""the quality control of this shoe is a bit disappointing"" or similar.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/entity] - ""亚瑟士"" (Ya Se Shi) is a transliteration of the brand name ""Asics,"" not ""Arthur."" This misidentification changes the meaning.
[Minor]: [over-translation/addition] - ""the cost to get it from Arthur"" is an over translation/addition. It's not specifying where it was bought from, it just mentions the brand name and price.

Terminology Errors

[Minor]: [Over-translation/Emphasis] - The repetition of ""tight"" (""it feels tight"") is not necessarily wrong, but it might not be the most elegant phrasing. A slightly better way to express the nuance might be ""it feels constricting"" or ""it feels narrow"".

A more accurate rendition would be something like ""wearing them now makes my feet feel hot"" or ""my feet feel hot when I wear them now.""

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""Lovefoot"" is likely a mistranslation of a brand name ""爱步"" which is commonly known as ECCO in English.
[Major]: [mistranslation/over-translation] - ""buy a UK7 number"" should be ""bought a UK7 size"", the word ""number"" is inappropriate here.
[Minor]: [mistranslation/inaccurate] - ""the upper foot is very hard"" should be ""putting them on is very hard."" It's not the ""upper foot"" that's hard, but the action of putting on the shoe.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""biased"" is an awkward word choice. ""Longer"" is more natural.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar/agreement] - ""this pair I refer comments"" should be ""this pair I referred to comments"" or ""for this pair, I looked at comments"".

1067,严重货不对板。,The seriousness of the matter.,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - The translation is completely incorrect. ""严重货不对板"" means ""The goods are seriously not as described"" or ""severely different from what was advertised/ordered"". The translation provided refers to a completely different concept, focusing on the ""seriousness of the matter"" which misses the core meaning related to product mismatch.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Seriousness"" is not the appropriate term.

The translation ""This is a very bad product"" is a general negative assessment, but misses the specific meaning that the product is different from what was promised.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While not strictly a terminology error, the generalized translation doesn't capture the industry context of false advertisement, which could be crucial.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Punctuation errors] - There is no punctuation usage in the original. The english sentence sounds rather definitive with the punctuation used.

""逗比"" is a slang term in Chinese which is similar to ""clown"" or ""joker"" but it can also mean silly, goofy, or funny. A better translation could be ""Are you trying to be funny/a clown/a joker?""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - ""Make fun of"" doesn't fully capture the nuance of ""逗比"". A better term like ""clown around"" could be used.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Grammar mistakes - The question format in the translation is unnatural. ""Do they make fun of you?"" sounds strange. A better question structure could be used.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/gender] - ""Breasts 99"" is a mistranslation of ""胸围99"". 胸围 means bust, which is typically the chest measurement for women. The user doesn't specify their gender, and the chest size could potentially apply to a man or a woman. However, translating it directly to ""breasts"" implies this is a woman. This introduces an inaccuracy.
[Minor]: [over-translation/addition] - The phrase ""got in the pit"" is an over-translation of the original Chinese. The meaning is that they almost got tricked, but ""got in the pit"" is slightly too literal and idiomatic.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - Using ""Breasts"" is technically incorrect terminology. While understandable in context, it's more accurate to use ""Chest"" or ""Bust measurement"".

Linguistic Convention Errors

[Major]: [Unnatural flow/awkward expressions] - ""consulting customer service before buying was told to buy XXL, and then read the comments decided to get L"" sounds somewhat awkward and unnatural.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation/addition] - ""it is not known how long you can play"" should be ""I don't know how long it can be played for"", the subject of the statement has been incorrectly translated.
[Major]: [mistranslation/inaccuracy] - ""because it is not the same as what you promised the child"" should be ""because it was a promise I made to the child"" - the translation misses the nuance of a promise already made, not a discrepancy between product and promise.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""top bolt"" is unusual phrasing. ""Tightening bolts"" might be better.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [linguistic convention/grammar] - ""Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the top bolt is difficult"" - could be improved by adding 'so' to the beginning of the second clause (so the top bolt...). This would make the sentence more grammatically sound.

Style Errors
[Minor]: [style/awkward phrasing] - ""Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the top bolt is difficult"" - it would read better if 'inserting' was used in place of 'top'.
[Minor]: [style/awkward phrasing] - ""and the quality of the workmanship is not good, and it is not known how long you can play"" - it would read better if 'so' was used in place of 'and', and the sentence was split: 'so the quality of the workmanship is not good.

[Minor]: [mistranslation/nuance] - ""The work is simple"" is a bit too simplistic. ""做工很一般"" suggests the craftsmanship is mediocre or average, not necessarily simple.

The user is stating that they will keep the item despite its flaws because they need it urgently.

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Mistranslation/over-translation] - ""preservative film"" is a slightly unnatural way to describe ""保鲜膜"". While technically accurate, ""cling film"" or ""plastic wrap"" would be more natural.
[Minor]: [Mistranslation/omission] - The phrase ""再说一下包装，就是用保鲜膜包了几层"" could be interpreted as ""Let's talk about the packaging again, it was wrapped with several layers of cling film."" The ""again"" aspect is omitted.

Linguistic Convention Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Omission] - ""玩得惊笑连连"" means ""played with a mix of surprise and laughter"" or ""played with a combination of excitement and laughter"". The translation ""He smiled and said..."" omits the actual playing and the mix of surprise and laughter.
[Major]: [Mistranslation/Over-translation] - The phrase ""for years to come"" is not present in the source text. The source text simply states that he would probably continue to buy this brand of toy.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While not strictly wrong, ""toy"" could be made more specific depending on the context, but this is a minor issue.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""圣诞节有看了下"" is mistranslated as ""I know the previous Christmas the price was about $150"". It should be something like ""I checked around Christmas"" or ""I looked at it around Christmas"". The original sentence implies that the speaker checked the price around Christmas time and noticed it was 150 yuan cheaper than what they previously paid. The translation implies the price itself was 150 dollars around Christmas.
[Minor]: [Addition] - Adding ""about"" before ""$150"" is unnecessary, as the original sentence doesn't suggest an approximation.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - The currency is not specified in the source, using ""$"" implies US dollars. The original could have been yuan or other currency.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""the previous Christmas the price was about $150"" is grammatically awkward. ""The price around Christmas..."" would be better.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - ""Specification"" is not the most appropriate term to describe a product manual or instruction booklet.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [omission] - The original sentence indicates that the sender will have to pay for postage themselves. This information is missing from the translation. The phrase ""只能自费邮寄"" is not accurately reflected.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - The phrase ""后补邮费"" translates to ""reimburse the postage later"". The translation suggests the customer will pay an ""additional charge for shipping"", which isn't quite right. It means they'll be reimbursed.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [incorrect term choice] - The term ""postage"" might be more appropriate than ""shipping"" in this context, though ""shipping"" isn't incorrect.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""西铁城"" (Xi Tie Cheng) is a transliteration of ""Citizen"", a Japanese watch brand. The translation incorrectly identifies it as ""western iron"".
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - The phrase ""不会差几秒"" means ""won't be off by more than a few seconds"". The translation ""it won't last a second more than a year or two"" completely misunderstands the meaning, implying the watch will break after a year or two, which is the opposite of the source's intended meaning (that it is accurate).

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While ""piece"" is not strictly wrong, ""watch"" would be a more natural and specific term.

Linguistic  Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - The sentence structure is awkward. A more natural phrasing would be ""If you've used a Citizen watch before...""

[Major]: [over-translation] - ""full-time notifications"" is a slightly awkward/literal translation of ""整点提醒"" which more accurately translates to ""hourly chime/alert."" It implies constant notifications which is not necessarily true.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""the 12 words on the dial are real diamonds"" is a mistranslation of “表盘的12字那里是真钻石”. It should be ""the '12' mark on the dial is made of real diamonds.""
[Minor]: [Over-translation] - ""it is convenient to wear"" is an over-translation of “这个自己戴很合适”. It should be closer to ""it's very suitable for wearing yourself"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""jewelery"" should be ""jewelry"" (spelling).

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - ""the package of the watch has a certificate of jewelery"" sounds a bit awkward. While not strictly grammatically incorrect, it would sound better as ""the watch package includes a jewelry certificate.""

Amazon ordered an 8p, available but not self-made, without a premium. Since self-made is not so easy, the system showed that the latest expected collection would be on September 27.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [Mistranslation] - ""the heart of a Malaysian"" is a mistranslation of ""心血来潮"", which means ""on a whim"" or ""suddenly had the idea."" This significantly changes the meaning.
[Major]: [Mistranslation] - ""self-made is not so easy"" is a mistranslation of ""不是自营的"", which means ""not sold directly by Amazon"". This is understandable given the context, but the translation is not accurate.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - While understandable, using ""8p"" is vague. It should be something like ""iPhone 8 Plus"" or similar to specify the product.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""After my wife's phone fell off on the night of September 23"" sounds slightly unnatural. ""After my wife dropped her phone on the night of September 23"" would be more idiomatic.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: Mistranslation - ""老婆没手机用难受死了"" translated as ""My wife didn't have a mobile phone, so she died"". This is a gross mistranslation. It should be something like ""My wife was extremely upset that she didn't have a phone"".
[Major]: Mistranslation - ""后来上京东一看"" translated as ""and then I went to Tokyo to see"". 京东 (Jingdong) is a Chinese e-commerce platform, not Tokyo.
[Minor]: Addition - ""only by ordering another one right away."" The word ""only"" makes it sound like there was a restriction but the original sentence did not suggest any limitations.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: Incorrect term choice - While acceptable, using ""mobile phone"" instead of ""phone"" or ""cell phone"" is slightly less natural in modern English.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: Grammar - ""thinking of a way to fix it"" is slightly awkward. ""Asking me to think of a solution"" would be smoother.

Style Errors
[Major]: Unnatural flow - The sentence structure is awkward and unnatural in English. ""My wife didn't have a mobile phone, so she died, so the next morning she called me at around 6am thinking of a way to fix it"" is a very stilted construction.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""凑包邮"" means ""to qualify for free shipping,"" not ""because of the packaging."" This affects the comprehension of the reason for purchasing the camera.

1157,买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。,"After buying it I had no problem whatsoever with the other problems, it was not connected during the software connection, my house is TP's router, after searching the web I found out that many people have this problem, and after more than two hours, I changed the settings of the router, and finally I used 360 WIFI as a medium to fix it, during which I called the Xiaomi customer service, they did not have any solution to this problem, and let me contact Amazon directly after sales.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [mistranslation] - ""其他的都没什么问题"" translates to ""everything else was fine"" or ""there were no other problems"". The translated sentence ""After buying it I had no problem whatsoever with the other problems"" is contradictory and doesn't make sense.
[Minor]: [over-translation] - The phrase ""售后"" translates to ""after-sales service"" or simply ""customer support."" ""Let me contact Amazon directly after sales"" is redundant.

Terminology Errors
[No error]

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""it was not connected during the software connection"" is grammatically awkward. Better wording is ""it wouldn't connect during software connection"".

Style Errors
[Major]: [unnatural flow] - The phrase ""used 360 WIFI as a medium to fix it"" is awkward and unclear. A better phrasing is ""used 360 WIFI as an intermediary to get it to work"" or ""used 360 WIFI as a workaround.""
[Minor]: [overly literal phrasing] - ""after searching the web I found out that many people have this problem, and after more than two hours, I changed the settings of the router"" is a bit clunky. Consider rephrasing for smoother flow.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""turn it on and on"" doesn't accurately convey the meaning of ""一直开启"" which means ""continuously on"" or ""always on.""

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Incorrect term choice] - ""machine"" can be more specific, such as ""device"" or whatever the machine is (e.g. phone, console).

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar mistakes] - ""It feels okay, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, the machine has a certain level of heat and it can be hard to accept if you turn it on and on."" The last clause could be improved in terms of flow and clarity. ""and it can be hard to accept"" isn't grammatically incorrect, but sounds awkward.

Style Errors
[Major]: [Unnatural flow] - The sentence structure is somewhat awkward, especially towards the end. ""It feels okay... but the sound quality is poor..."" is acceptable but there are better ways to express this.

Terminology Errors
[Critical]: [Incorrect term choice] - While ""first love of my life"" is technically correct, ""first love"" is more common and natural-sounding.

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: omission - The phrase ""就心痛的想要离开这个世界"" is not fully conveyed. It means the pain is so intense it makes him want to leave this world, hinting at suicidal thoughts. The translation, ""my heart aches to leave this world,"" is a weaker expression and misses the severity.
[Minor]: over-translation - ""至今还没能走出来"" translates to ""still hasn't been able to move on"". The translation ""and I have not been able to get out until now"" feels slightly too literal and clunky.

Accuracy Errors
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""想想两个当时感觉"" is mistranslated as ""I thought of how it felt then"". A more accurate translation would be ""I recall the feelings I had then"" or ""I remember the feelings I had at the time."" The original phrase emphasizes remembering the feelings, not the act of thinking.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""还是能一起同甘共苦"" is mistranslated as ""that you can still share the pain of the same time"". This phrase means ""still be able to share happiness and suffering together"". The translation is awkward and doesn't fully convey the meaning.
[Major]: [mistranslation] - ""不堪回首"" is mistranslated as ""unbearable"". The literal translation would be ""cannot bear to look back"" but the sentiment being conveyed is ""it's unbearable to remember/look back upon"". The translation is partially accurate but misses the reflective aspect.

Linguistic Convention Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""some people don't want to meet for the rest of their lives"" is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward. ""Some people you never want to meet again"" would be more natural.
[Minor]: [grammar] - ""some things they don't want to know for the rest of their lives"" is grammatically correct but sounds slightly awkward. ""Some things you never want to know"" would be more natural.

Terminology Errors
