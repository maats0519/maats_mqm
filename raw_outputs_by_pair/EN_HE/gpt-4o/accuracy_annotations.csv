499,Everyone with their hair on fire about CNN can thank Stephen Colbert for the hard right turn.,כולם עם השיער באש בגלל CNN יכולים להודות לסטיבן קולבר על הפנייה החדה ימינה.,"```
MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [accuracy/mistranslation] - The phrase ""hard right turn"" is mistranslated as ""הפנייה החדה ימינה,"" which means ""the sharp turn to the right"" without conveying the political context of a ""hard right turn.""
[Major]: [accuracy/mistranslation] - The phrase ""Everyone with their hair on fire"" is mistranslated as ""כולם עם השיער באש,"" which literally means ""everyone with their hair on fire,"" missing the idiomatic expression meaning people being very upset or alarmed.
[Minor]: [accuracy/omission] - The phrase ""can thank"" is translated as ""יכולים להודות,"" which is correct, but the context of sarcasm or irony in the original expression is not fully captured.
