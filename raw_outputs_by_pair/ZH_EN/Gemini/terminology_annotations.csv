MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
Minor: WRONG TERM - ""Appendix D of the 2005 edition"" is redundant after ""Appendix D"". While the source also repeats the term (""附录 D, 2005 年版的附录D""), a more natural English phrasing would be ""(see Appendix D; specifically, Appendix D of the 2005 edition)"" or possibly just ""(see Appendix D of the 2005 edition)"" if context allows, or ""(see Appendix D, and Appendix D of the 2005 edition)"" if they are distinct. The direct repetition is slightly awkward and could be considered a contextual misfit of the term due to redundancy, though it reflects the source structure.

No-error - The translated terms ""Information Technology"" and ""Chinese Encoding Character Set"" are standard English terms and appropriate translations for the concepts (信息技术 - Information Technology; 中文编码字符集 - Chinese Encoding Character Set). Although the source text contains a likely typo (""信息扩术"" instead of ""信息技术""), the translation correctly identifies the intended meaning and uses the standard corresponding English term. There are no terminology errors (e.g., wrong term choice, typos, capitalization, inflection) within the translated terms themselves.

minor: [terminology/locale_conventions/formatting] - The separator '一' in the Chinese standard number 'GB/I 11383 一 1989' was translated to an em dash '—' in 'GB/I 11383—1989', which is a standard locale convention difference for formatting standard designations but technically a change from the source character.
minor: [terminology/locale_conventions/punctuation] - The source uses a space and closing quotation mark ' ”' after '信息 处理' to separate the main subject from the specific topic.

MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [terminology/locale_conventions/other] - The hex code ranges in the source (e.g., 0x82358F33 一 0x82359636) appear corrupted or nonsensical for standard CJK character ranges and use the character '一' as a separator. The translation correctly uses a hyphen '-' standard for English ranges but retains the questionable numeric values from the source. While retaining source values can be faithful, these specific values likely represent a source data error rather than a valid range, impacting technical accuracy. The primary issue is likely source error/accuracy, not just locale convention.
[Minor]: [terminology/no_error] - None. The core technical terms (""Level 1"", ""CJK Unified Ideographs"", ""CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A"", ""single-byte"", ""double-byte"", ""four-byte"") are translated correctly, including accurate interpretation despite several typos in the source text (""文持"", ""双季节"", ""四字下编玛"", ""扩A"").

MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
[minor]: [WRONG TERM] - ""Appendix K"" is not a direct translation of ""附录开"". While ""Appendix"" is correct for ""附录"", ""K"" does not correspond to ""开"". It should ideally reflect the actual appendix designator used in the Chinese standard (e.g., Appendix A, B, etc., or perhaps if ""开"" has a specific meaning here, it needs context). Assuming ""K"" is an interpretation or external information, the direct source character ""开"" is not represented. If the appendix is indeed designated ""K"" in the standard's structure, this might be acceptable, but based purely on the source text ""开"", ""K"" is not a translation.

Accuracy Errors
major: terminology/inappropriate for context - ""bags/capsules"" is likely an incorrect term for ""囊"" in the context of lights being connected in series. A term like ""housings"", ""units"", or simply ""lights"" would probably be more appropriate, although the source text itself is unclear.
minor: accuracy/mistranslation - ""recover/reset"" for ""恢六"" is a reasonable guess, but the source ""恢六"" is likely corrupt (possibly should be 恢复 - recover/restore).
minor: fluency/grammar - ""connected as if passing through series"" is awkward phrasing, potentially due to interpreting the unclear source segment ""如自过串联"". A more standard phrasing would be ""are connected in series"".

Terminology errors:
[minor]: [WRONG TERM] - The translation uses ""dual ear modes"" in the first sentence and ""stereo mode"" in the second and fourth sentences for the same source concept (双耳). While ""stereo"" is contextually correct, using two different terms for the same concept introduces inconsistency. Sticking to one defined term (""dual ear mode"" or ""stereo mode"") would be preferable if a glossary existed.
[minor]: [WRONG TERM] - The translation uses ""single ear modes"" in the first sentence and ""mono mode"" in the third sentence for the same source concept (单耳). Similar to the point above, while ""mono"" is contextually correct, the inconsistency with ""single ear mode"" should be avoided by choosing one term.
