259,世界各地的吸毒现象一直在增多，无论是从总体数字还是从吸毒者在世界人口中所占比例来看都是如此。,"Drug use is increasing worldwide, both in terms of total numbers and as a proportion of the world's population.",Both the outright number of individuals utilizing drugs and the rate of the worldwide populace utilizing drugs have been rising.
262,"这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。",This partly reflects the differences in overall population growth during this period—7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries—but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.,"This to some degree reflects the reality that worldwide populace development amid the time shifted between industrialized and creating nations, at 7% and 28%, separately, but it moreover reflects the more youthful populaces in poorer nations developing more rapidly."
263,青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。,Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.,Youthful individuals and young people account for the larger part of sedate clients.

267,吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。,"Part of the overall increase in drug use is due to the massive population shift from rural to urban areas—currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.","More than half of the world's populace presently lives in urban locales, up from 34% in 1960, and this colossal relocation from rustic to urban regions is to a great extent to fault for the common rise in sedate utilize."
268,城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。,"Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.","Urbanization may play a critical part within the dynamics of sedate markets within the future, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more articulated."

274,这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。,These patterns seem less common in wealthier social classes.,These patterns appear to be less predominant among financial classes with more prominent riches.
277,新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。,"The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. More farmers may increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by national authorities, or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities due to the economic crisis.","The pharma showcase seem develop encourage as a result of COVID-19, got to take chances and do illegal things."
283,会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。,Member states' domestic markets see approximately 500 new active substances each year.,"On the residential showcase of Part States, around 500 modern dynamic chemicals are presented each year."
286,"在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。","Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, synthetic opioid new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.","In 2014, opioid NPS made up fair 2% of all NPS found; by 2018, this extent had expanded to 9%."
287,类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。,"Many novel psychoactive substances in the opioid class are fentanyl analogs, the efficacy and harm of which have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America, and also in other regions, but to a lesser extent.","Overdose passing from NPS opioids, numerous of which are fentanyl analogs, have been reported in North America and, to a lesser degree, abroad."
288,在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。,"In North America, fentanyl is sometimes used as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and sometimes used to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.",Fentanyl is utilized in North America to create fake pharmaceutical painkillers or as a doping specialist for heroin and other substances like cocaine and methamphetamine.
