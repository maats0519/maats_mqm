MQM annotations:
Style Errors:
Minor: Unnatural Flow - The phrase ""the rules given in"" is slightly wordy/redundant. While grammatically correct, simply stating ""in accordance with GB/T 1.1-2020..."" is often more concise and natural in English technical documents, as citing the standard implies following its rules or provisions.

MQM annotations:
Styles error:
[major]: [style/unnatural_flow] - The repetition ""Appendix D, Appendix D"" is awkward and unnatural in English, stemming from a too-literal translation of the source structure.
[minor]: [style/unnatural_flow] - The semicolon at the very end of the sentence, especially after the closing parenthesis, is not standard English punctuation in this context and makes the sentence slightly awkward.

MQM annotations:
Styles error:
minor: style/unnatural_flow - ""The publishing organization of this document"" sounds slightly literal and less natural than ""The publisher of this document"" or ""The organization publishing this document"".
minor: style/unnatural_flow - ""any or all such patent rights"" is slightly wordy, though common in legalistic text. ""any such patent rights"" would suffice.

MQM annotations:
Styles error:
Minor: Locale Convention/Formatting - The source uses ""一 1989"" after the standard number. The translation uses ""—1989"". While using a dash is appropriate, the standard format for GB standards in English is typically GB/T XXXX-YYYY (using a hyphen, not an em dash). Using ""—"" instead of ""-"" is a minor formatting deviation from the most common convention for GB standards.

MQM annotations:
Style error:
minor: [style/unnatural_flow] - While grammatically correct, the repetition of ""Chinese characters... are assigned... code points"" makes the sentence structure slightly less elegant and more literal than ideal.

MQM annotations:
major: style/unnatural_flow - The phrase ""Two-character vegetable part"" is awkward and unnatural as a modifier for ""encoding space structure diagram"".

However, the current phrasing is understandable and common enough not to be a major issue.
```"
88,码位范围码位数字符数,"Code point range, number of code points, number of characters","```
MQM annotations:
Style error:
[minor]: [unnatural flow] - The original Chinese concatenates three terms without punctuation, likely as a compact header or label. The English translation uses commas, which is natural for a list, but the lack of conjunction (like ""and"") before the last item makes it slightly abrupt or less smooth than it could be, although still understandable. ""Code point range, number of code points, and number of characters"" would flow slightly better, but the current version isn't strictly wrong, just slightly unnatural in its list structure.

MQM annotations:
Style error:

130,全包围结构,Full enclosure structure,"```
MQM annotations:
Style Errors:
minor: Style/Unnatural Flow - While technically correct as a literal translation, ""Full enclosure structure"" might sound slightly technical or jargony depending on the context. More common ways to refer to this type of Chinese character structure might be ""fully enclosed structure"" or simply explaining it as characters where one component completely surrounds another (e.g., 国, 围). However, without more context, ""Full enclosure structure"" is acceptable, making this a very minor point.

However, it is still functionally descriptive.
```"
136,回右上包围结构,Upper right enclosing structure,"```

Minor: Unnatural Flow - ""For related information about this procedure"" is slightly unnatural. A more common phrasing might be ""For more information about this procedure"" or ""For related information regarding this procedure"". However, the current phrasing is understandable.

Press and hold for about 1 second then release.","```
MQM annotations:
Styles error:
[minor]: [style/unnatural_flow] - The sentence structure strings together multiple functions separated by semicolons and then abruptly ends the list with a period before stating the final function as a separate sentence. While grammatically correct, using semicolons throughout or restructuring (e.g., using bullet points if format allows) could improve flow and readability for a list of functions. Example: ""...play/pause audio; press and hold for about 1 second then release.""

429,待机时， 开启语音助手(需设备支持语音功能且打开快速唤醒设置),"During standby, activate the voice assistant (requires the device to support voice function and the quick wake-up setting to be enabled).","```
MQM annotations:
Style Errors:
minor: [style/unnatural flow] - The phrasing ""requires the device to support voice function and the quick wake-up setting to be enabled"" is grammatically correct but slightly clunky and less direct than it could be. It reads a bit like a literal translation of the structure. More natural alternatives might include: ""(requires device voice support and quick wake-up enabled)"" or ""(the device must support the voice function and have the quick wake-up setting enabled)"". However, the current phrasing is understandable and only a minor flow issue.

MQM annotations:
Styles error:
[Minor]: [Unnatural Flow] - The use of ""---"" as a separator between the voltage (5V) and current (100mA) is unnatural and non-standard in English technical specifications. Standard separators like ""/"", "","", or ""@"" would be more appropriate and improve readability.

MQM annotations:
Styles error:
Minor: [Unnatural Flow] - The phrase ""as thunderstorms can cause the device to malfunction and increase the risk of electric shock"" is grammatically correct but slightly wordy. A more concise phrasing like ""as they can cause malfunction and increase the risk of electric shock"" or ""as they can cause the device to malfunction and increase electric shock risk"" might flow slightly better in technical documentation. However, the current phrasing is perfectly understandable and common.

MQM annotations:
critical: no-error
major: no-error
minor: 
style/unnatural_flow - While ""Attention"" is a direct translation, depending on the context (e.g., a note in a document), ""Note"" or ""Caution"" might be more natural or stylistically appropriate in English. ""Attention"" can sound a bit stark or overly formal as a standalone word.

MQM annotations:
Styles error:
minor: style/unnatural_flow - The placement of ""reasonably"" at the very end of the sentence (""please control the usage time and volume reasonably"") feels slightly less natural in English instructional text compared to placing it before the verb (""please reasonably control..."") or using a different phrasing like ""...control the usage time and volume appropriately.""

Styles error:
[minor]: [unnatural_flow] - The phrase ""from the day after you sign for receipt"" is grammatically correct but slightly wordy and literal compared to more natural alternatives like ""starting the day after receipt"".
[minor]: [company_style] - Use of non-standard English punctuation 《》 around the document title ""Redmi AirDots 2 ee E Fault Table"".

MQM annotations:
Styles error:
minor: style/unnatural_flow - ""EU Summit quarrels"" sounds slightly unnatural, as if the summit itself is quarreling. A more natural phrasing might involve specifying the participants, like ""Endless quarrels over refugee policy at EU Summit"" or ""Participants at EU Summit quarrel endlessly over refugee policy"".

MQM annotations:
Style error:
minor: Style/Unnatural Flow - The semicolon creates a slightly long and less punchy sentence; splitting it into two sentences might improve flow for some readers, although it's grammatically correct. e.g., ""Reportedly, the EU's move is a response to growing concerns over Europe's illegal immigration problem. The core issue for the EU now is that very few illegal immigrants are ultimately repatriated.""

MQM annotations:
Style error:
Minor: Unnatural Flow - ""the EU's Schengen countries"" sounds slightly less natural than ""Schengen countries in the EU"" or simply ""Schengen countries"" (as the context implies they are within the EU sphere of reporting). However, it's a very minor point and understandable.
