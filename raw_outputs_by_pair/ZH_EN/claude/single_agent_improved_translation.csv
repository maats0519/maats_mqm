259,世界各地的吸毒现象一直在增多，无论是从总体数字还是从吸毒者在世界人口中所占比例来看都是如此。,"The phenomenon of drug abuse is constantly increasing worldwide, whether in terms of the overall numbers or the proportion of drug users in the world population.","The phenomenon of drug use is constantly increasing worldwide, whether in terms of the overall numbers or the proportion of drug users in the global population."
262,"这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。","This to a certain extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.","This to a certain degree reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries."
263,青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。,The proportion of adolescents and young adults is the highest among drug users.,Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
266,无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。,"Regardless of whether it is a developed country or a developing country, the drug abuse situation in urban areas is more serious than in rural areas.","The drug abuse situation is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas, regardless of whether it is a developed or developing country."
267,吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。,"The overall increase in drug abuse is partly due to the large-scale migration of the population from rural to urban areas - currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.","The overall increase in drug abuse is partly due to the large-scale migration of the population from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960."
268,城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。,"City-ization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.","Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced."

274,这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。,These patterns seem to be less common among the more affluent social strata.,These patterns seem to be less common among the more affluent social strata.
277,新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。,"The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause more farmers to increase or engage in the cultivation of illegal crops, either due to a decrease in the control capabilities of the competent national authorities, or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.","The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market, as more farmers engage in illegal crop cultivation or more people turn to illegal activities due to the economic crisis."
283,会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。,The domestic market of member countries has about 500 new active substances every year.,The domestic markets of member countries have about 500 new active substances each year.
286,"在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。","In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioid-type new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.","In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioid-like new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%."
287,类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。,"Many of the novel psychoactive substances in the opioid-like class are fentanyl analogues, whose pharmacological effects and harms have been demonstrated. They have led to overdose deaths in North America, and have also occurred in other regions, though to a lesser extent.","Many of the novel psychoactive substances that are similar to opioids are analogues of fentanyl, whose pharmacological effects and harms have been demonstrated. They have led to overdose deaths in North America, and have also occurred in other regions, though to a lesser extent."
288,在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。,"In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and is also used to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.","In North America, fentanyl is used to adulterate heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and is also used to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids."
290,2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中,The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched among vulnerable populations.,The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established among vulnerable populations.
