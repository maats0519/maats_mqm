239,在许多国家，这一疾病己使医疗服务机构穷于应付，几近崩溃，各国政府实施的限制措施已在全球经济中造成了严重紊乱。,"In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed medical service institutions, bringing them close to collapse, and the restrictive measures implemented by governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.","The affliction has disabled wellbeing frameworks in a few countries to the point of collapse, and government confinements have seriously disturbed the world economy."
241,一些生产者可能会被迫寻找新的方法来制造毒品，因为限制流动的同时也限制了前体和基本化学品的获取。,"Some producers may be forced to seek new methods to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on mobility also limit access to precursors and basic chemicals.","Due to the constrained get to to antecedents and essential chemicals caused by development confinements, certain makers may be obliged to create modern strategies of medicine generation."
249,一些国家有大量毒品通过商业航班走私，预计这些国家的贩毒活动受到的直接影响最大。,"Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that the drug trafficking activities in these countries will be most directly affected.",Nations where noteworthy sums of opiates are snuck on commercial flights are expected to be most extremely affected.
259,世界各地的吸毒现象一直在增多，无论是从总体数字还是从吸毒者在世界人口中所占比例来看都是如此。,"The phenomenon of drug abuse is constantly increasing worldwide, whether in terms of the overall numbers or the proportion of drug users in the world population.",Both the outright number of individuals utilizing drugs and the rate of the worldwide populace utilizing drugs have been rising.
262,"这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。","This to a certain extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.","This to some degree reflects the reality that worldwide populace development amid the time shifted between industrialized and creating nations, at 7% and 28%, separately, but it moreover reflects the more youthful populaces in poorer nations developing more rapidly."
263,青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。,The proportion of adolescents and young adults is the highest among drug users.,Youthful individuals and young people account for the larger part of sedate clients.
266,无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。,"Regardless of whether it is a developed country or a developing country, the drug abuse situation in urban areas is more serious than in rural areas.","Urban zones are more likely than country ones to have a sedate issue, both in created and creating countries."
267,吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。,"The overall increase in drug abuse is partly due to the large-scale migration of the population from rural to urban areas - currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.","More than half of the world's populace presently lives in urban locales, up from 34% in 1960, and this colossal relocation from rustic to urban regions is to a great extent to fault for the common rise in sedate utilize."
268,城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。,"City-ization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.","Urbanization may play a critical part within the dynamics of sedate markets within the future, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more articulated."
273,来自少数几个国家的数据表明，有害的吸毒模式与病症同低收入之间存在联系。,The data from a few countries indicates that harmful drug use patterns are associated with low-income conditions.,"Moo pay and unsafe medicate utilize designs and conditions are related, agreeing to information from a little number of countries."
274,这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。,These patterns seem to be less common among the more affluent social strata.,These patterns appear to be less predominant among financial classes with more prominent riches.
277,新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。,"The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause more farmers to increase or engage in the cultivation of illegal crops, either due to a decrease in the control capabilities of the competent national authorities, or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.","The pharma showcase seem develop encourage as a result of COVID-19, got to take chances and do illegal things."
283,会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。,The domestic market of member countries has about 500 new active substances every year.,"On the residential showcase of Part States, around 500 modern dynamic chemicals are presented each year."
286,"在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。","In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioid-type new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.","In 2014, opioid NPS made up fair 2% of all NPS found; by 2018, this extent had expanded to 9%."
287,类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。,"Many of the novel psychoactive substances in the opioid-like class are fentanyl analogues, whose pharmacological effects and harms have been demonstrated. They have led to overdose deaths in North America, and have also occurred in other regions, though to a lesser extent.","Overdose passing from NPS opioids, numerous of which are fentanyl analogs, have been reported in North America and, to a lesser degree, abroad."
288,在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。,"In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and is also used to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.",Fentanyl is utilized in North America to create fake pharmaceutical painkillers or as a doping specialist for heroin and other substances like cocaine and methamphetamine.
290,2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中,The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched among vulnerable populations.,2 Modern psychoactive sedate utilize seem ended up broadly acknowledged in vulnerable communities
295,贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。,"Drug traffickers and drug manufacturers have been looking for substitutes, not only substances with less stringent controls, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, the so-called ""specially designed precursors"".","Medicate makers and traffickers are continually investigating for substitutes, counting not as it were less entirely controlled drugs but moreover substances made intentioned to urge over existing directions, or ""architect antecedents."""
296,旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。,The restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.,Medicate producers who depend on antecedent chemicals would certainly feel the impacts of prohibitive measures planning to halt the spread of COVID-19.
