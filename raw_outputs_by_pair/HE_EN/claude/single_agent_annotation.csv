Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - The translation does not fully capture the meaning of the original text. The phrase ""to carry out corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket"" does not convey the same meaning as ""לבצע בתהליך הרחבת הסל תיקונים ושיפורים"" which suggests that the improvements and corrections should be made to the basket itself, not just the process of expanding it.
