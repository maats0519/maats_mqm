[major]: [unnatural flow] - The translation reads too literally and lacks the natural flow expected in the target language. A more natural expression could be used.

The original Japanese sentence:
ゴム紐は6mmの平ゴム形状なので、耳への当たりが柔らかく、よくある耳の痛みも軽減してくれます。

The English translation:
The rubber band has a flat rubber shape of 6mm, so it is soft on the ears and can reduce the common ear pain.

Explanation:
The translation is accurate, but the phrasing ""it is soft on the ears and can reduce the common ear pain"" sounds a bit unnatural and overly literal compared to how a native English speaker would express the same idea. A more natural flow could be achieved by rephrasing it, for example: ""The 6mm flat rubber shape makes it gentle on the ears and helps alleviate common ear discomfort."""
