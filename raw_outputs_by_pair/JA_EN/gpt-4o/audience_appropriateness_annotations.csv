451,※熱湯は入れないで下さい。,*Please do not pour boiling water.*,"```
MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE] - The phrase ""boiling water"" may not convey the same level of caution as the original Japanese phrase, which is often used in contexts where safety and caution are emphasized more explicitly in Japanese culture. This could subtly detract from the cultural appropriateness of the warning.

459,店頭でフックなどに吊り下げることができる便利な穴付きです。,"""It has a convenient hole that allows it to be hung on hooks at the store.""","```
MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [Culture-specific Reference] - The phrase ""at the store"" may not be necessary or relevant for all audiences, as the original Japanese text does not specify a location. It could be more culturally neutral to omit this specification unless the context requires it.

MQM annotations:

MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE] - The phrase ""cool, dry place"" is a common expression in English-speaking contexts for storage instructions, but it may not fully capture the nuance of ""高温多湿を避け"" (avoid high temperatures and humidity) in Japanese, which emphasizes avoiding specific conditions rather than just suggesting a general storage environment.

MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
Minor: Culture-specific Reference - The phrase ""inexpensive and strong"" may not fully capture the cultural emphasis on cost-effectiveness and durability that is often highlighted in Japanese product descriptions. While the translation is accurate, it could be slightly adjusted to better resonate with an English-speaking audience by emphasizing the balance of cost and strength.
