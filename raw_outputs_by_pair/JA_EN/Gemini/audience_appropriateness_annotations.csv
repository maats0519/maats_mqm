299,※電池のアルカリ液が目に入ったときは失明などのおそれがあるので、すぐに多量のきれいな水で洗い流し、 医師の治療を受ける。,"If alkaline battery fluid gets into your eyes, there is a risk of blindness, so immediately flush them with plenty of clean water and seek medical attention.","MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""alkaline battery fluid"" sounds somewhat technical for a general audience. While accurate, using something like ""battery acid"" might be more immediately understandable for the average person, even though it's not technically precise."

318,※回転体を伴う機械作業では、使用しないでください。,Do not use when performing machine work involving rotating parts.,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While technically accurate, the translation ""Do not use when performing machine work involving rotating parts"" sounds slightly unnatural and could be phrased more clearly for a general audience. A more user-friendly phrasing like ""Do not use this during machine operations where parts are rotating"" might be preferable."

323,のり残りが少なくタテ裂けが起こりにくいです。,Leaves little adhesive residue and is resistant to tearing vertically.,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""tearing vertically"" could be more naturally expressed as ""vertical tearing"" or ""tearing along its length"" for better readability in English. While not strictly an error, it affects the flow and naturalness."

minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""Please note that"" at the beginning is somewhat redundant and could be more concise (e.g., ""Note that""). While not strictly inappropriate, it adds unnecessary formality."
349,※養生後、テープを早く剥すと破断する恐れがありますので、ゆっくり剥してください。,"After curing, peeling the tape off quickly may cause tearing, so please peel it off slowly.","MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""After curing"" is not technically incorrect, but in this context, ""after allowing to set"" or ""after it has set"" would be more natural and clear for an English-speaking audience familiar with using tape."
350,※粘着剤特有のにおいがありますので、換気の良い所でのご使用をお勧めします。,"※Due to the adhesive's characteristic odor, it is recommended to use it in a well-ventilated area.","MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The sentence ""Due to the adhesive's characteristic odor, it is recommended to use it in a well-ventilated area"" is grammatically correct and understandable, but it could be slightly improved for naturalness in English. A more natural phrasing might be ""This adhesive has a characteristic odor, so it is best to use it in a well-ventilated area."" However, the current translation is still acceptable."
351,※被着体と養生期間によっては、被着体を汚染・損傷する場合がありますので、ご使用前にお確かめください。,Please test before use as certain substrates and curing periods may result in staining or damage to the substrate.,"MQM annotations:

minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""binding force"" sounds overly technical and potentially unnatural for a general audience.

365,※取り付けの際には現車取り付け部に真っ直ぐ取り付け作業を行ってください。,"When installing, make sure to install it straight onto the mounting area of the actual vehicle.","MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""actual vehicle"" is slightly redundant, as the context already implies the vehicle in question. While not strictly incorrect, it could be phrased more concisely for a smoother read."

minor: style/awkward - The sentence structure is a bit formal and could be rephrased for better flow in casual English. While grammatically correct, it reads a little stiff."

minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""please reconfirm"" sounds slightly unnatural in English. ""Double-check"" or ""confirm again"" might be more common and sound more natural."
373,※わずかな違いでも大きなトラブルになる場合がございます。,Even slight differences can lead to major problems.,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is grammatically correct and conveys the meaning, but it could be more idiomatic or natural-sounding in English. For example, phrasing it as ""Even minor discrepancies..."" or ""Even small differences..."" might improve the flow and impact for an English-speaking audience. However, this is a very minor issue."
378,白メリヤスウエス 中古生地,"White knitted wiping cloths, used fabric","MQM annotations:

380,ウエス製品の中で優れた製品です。,It is an excellent product among WES products.,"MQM annotations:
minor: terminology/inappropriate for context - ""WES products"" might not be understandable without prior context. While not strictly wrong, it's vague and could be improved for broader audience understanding by specifying what WES refers to."
382,カット済。,Cut済 = Already cut.,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference/jargon - ""Cut済"" is Japanese jargon. Translating it literally as ""Cut済 = Already cut"" is not inappropriate but might not be easily understood by a general English-speaking audience without some prior knowledge of Japanese business practices or internet culture, where abbreviated terms are often used. A more natural translation might be ""Pre-cut"" or ""Already cut,"" without including the romanized ""済."""
390,※用途以外に使用しないでください。,Do not use for purposes other than those specified.,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is too literal and sounds unnatural in English. A more natural phrasing might be ""Use only as directed"" or ""Use only for the intended purpose."" While not strictly *wrong*, it's not idiomatic."

audience appropriateness error:
minor: culture-specific reference/terminology - ""Cable tie"" while technically accurate, might be less common in everyday language for some English speakers compared to terms like ""zip tie"" or ""tie wrap.""

minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""as if to crush it a little"" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for a smoother, more natural tone in English. A more common phrasing might be ""slightly depress"" or ""apply a little pressure."" This isn't a major issue, but refining it would improve the overall flow."
435,※内容物、洗浄廃液や容器を廃棄する場合は、都道府県の許可を受けた専門の廃棄物処理業者に委託してください。,"When disposing of the contents, cleaning waste fluid, or containers, please entrust disposal to a specialized waste disposal contractor licensed by the prefectural government.","MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference/level of formality - The phrase ""please entrust disposal to"" is overly formal and could be rephrased for a more natural tone in English, which might be perceived as less demanding or bureaucratic.

461,表面にエンボス加工入り。,Embossed surface.,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is too literal and lacks context. While technically correct, ""Embossed surface"" by itself doesn't convey much meaning without knowing what the surface belongs to. Depending on the product and target audience, a more descriptive phrase might be preferable."
464,※幼児や子供がかぶって遊ぶと窒息などの危険がありますのでご注意ください。,Please be careful as there is a risk of suffocation if infants or children play with this by putting it on their heads.,"MQM annotations:
