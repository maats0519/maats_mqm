Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""adhesive residue"" doesn't fully capture the nuance of ""貼り跡やのり残り"" which refers to both adhesive marks/traces and remaining adhesive. A more precise translation within the glossary would be beneficial.
```"
329,※ティシューは水に溶けにくいため、水洗トイレには流さないでください。,Please do not flush tissues down the toilet as they do not dissolve easily in water.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""tissues"" should ideally be specified as facial tissues to align with the everyday understanding of the word in English, as ""ティシュー"" typically refers to facial tissues.
```"
331,※引火の原因になりますので、火気の近くに置かないでください。,"To prevent ignition, do not place near open flames or sources of heat.","MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""open flames"" is a literal translation of 火気 and while not incorrect, ""sources of ignition"" or ""naked flames"" would be more idiomatic and natural in this context.
```"
334,プロユーザーにも安心してご使用いただける品質の、弱粘着タイプ養生テープです。,This is a low-tack masking tape with a quality that professional users can rely on.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
339,手で簡単にカットできる養生用ポリエチレンクロステープで耐候性・耐水性に優れています。,This is a polyethylene cloth tape for temporary use that can be easily cut by hand and has excellent weather resistance and water resistance.,"```
MQM annotations
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The term ""養生用ポリエチレンクロステープ"" is translated as ""polyethylene cloth tape for temporary use."" While technically correct, ""養生"" in this context implies a more specific type of temporary use related to protection during construction or painting. ""Temporary use"" is too broad. A more precise term might be ""protective polyethylene cloth tape"" or ""painter's polyethylene cloth tape,"" depending on the intended use. However, this is a minor issue as the general meaning is conveyed.
```"
340,再はくり性が良好です。,It has good re-releasing properties.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""re-releasing properties"" is not a standard or readily understandable term in English for ""再はくり性"" (re-peelability or re-releasability). While not entirely wrong, ""re-releasing"" is awkward. A better term might be ""releasability"".
```"
341,※貼る対象物や使用環境によっては、粘着力等数値通りの値が出ない場合がございます。,Please note that the adhesive strength and other values may not meet the stated specifications depending on the object to which the product is applied and the usage environment.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
349,※養生後、テープを早く剥すと破断する恐れがありますので、ゆっくり剥してください。,"After curing, peeling the tape off quickly may cause tearing, so please peel it off slowly.","```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""curing"" should be ""after application"" to be compliant with the glossary.
```"
350,※粘着剤特有のにおいがありますので、換気の良い所でのご使用をお勧めします。,"※Due to the adhesive's characteristic odor, it is recommended to use it in a well-ventilated area.","```
MQM annotations
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/grammatical error - ""adhesive's"" should be ""adhesive"" or ""adhesive's characteristic"".
```"
351,※被着体と養生期間によっては、被着体を汚染・損傷する場合がありますので、ご使用前にお確かめください。,Please test before use as certain substrates and curing periods may result in staining or damage to the substrate.,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The translation of ""被着体"" as ""substrates"" doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""object to be adhered to"" or ""adherend."" While technically correct, it's slightly less precise.
minor: WRONG TERM - The translation of ""養生期間"" as ""curing periods"" is acceptable but could be more accurately rendered as ""curing time"" or ""setting time,"" depending on the context.
```"
356,従来品に比べ耐候性がアップしました。,"Compared to the conventional product, the weather resistance has been improved.","```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""weather resistance"" should be ""weatherability"" to align with the glossary entry definition.
```"
360,保管する場合は密閉することを推奨します。,Sealing is recommended for storage.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
362,※一度ご使用された製品を再度ご使用にされることで、結束力不足により不具合が発生する可能性があります。,Reusing a product that has already been used may cause defects due to insufficient binding force.,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""binding force"" is a possible translation of ""結束力"", but the more common (and therefore, better) term in this context is ""adhesion""."
365,※取り付けの際には現車取り付け部に真っ直ぐ取り付け作業を行ってください。,"When installing, make sure to install it straight onto the mounting area of the actual vehicle.","MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The term ""mounting area"" is a possible translation for 取り付け部, but ""mounting location"" or ""mounting point"" would be a more natural and accurate translation in this context. It's not incorrect, just slightly less appropriate.
```"
368,現在販売している商品は品質確認済になりますのでご安心してご使用下さい。,"The products currently being sold have had their quality checked, so please use them with confidence.","```
MQM annotations:
```"
369,※当製品は交換作業を整備業者へ依頼して行う事をおすすめします。,We recommend that you have a professional mechanic perform the replacement work for this product.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The term ""professional mechanic"" is a bit too generic. A more precise term would be ""certified technician"" or ""qualified technician"" to reflect the requirement of formal training/certification for the task.
```"
370,個人で交換作業を行った場合は補償出来ない場合もございます。,We may not be able to provide compensation if you performed the replacement work yourself.,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""replacement work"" may not be the best fit for ""交換作業"" which refers to the entire process, potentially including repair or modification. ""Replacement"" suggests a direct swap, whereas ""作業"" can be broader. A more neutral term like ""work"" or ""repair work"" might be more accurate.
```"
371,※ネジ寸法が各オイルフィルターで異なっている為、高さや外径などが同じフィルターに見えても取り付け前に再度、車種とネジ寸法をご確認ください。,"※Because screw dimensions differ for each oil filter, even if filters appear to be the same in height or outer diameter, please reconfirm the vehicle model and screw dimensions before installation.","MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The term ""oil filter"" should be consistently translated, but ""filters"" is used here instead of ""oil filter"".
```"
373,※わずかな違いでも大きなトラブルになる場合がございます。,Even slight differences can lead to major problems.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
378,白メリヤスウエス 中古生地,"White knitted wiping cloths, used fabric","```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""knitted wiping cloths"" should be ""white cotton rags"" to better reflect the common understanding and usage of ""白メリヤスウエス"".
```"
380,ウエス製品の中で優れた製品です。,It is an excellent product among WES products.,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""WES products"" should likely be ""wiping cloth products"" or similar based on the context of ウエス. ""WES"" is not a standard English abbreviation for this."
382,カット済。,Cut済 = Already cut.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/ Wrong Term - The translation ""Already cut"" doesn't reflect the meaning of ""cut済"" in this context. ""済"" (zumi) implies that the action is completed or finished, so a more appropriate translation would be ""Already processed"" or ""Already completed"".
```"
390,※用途以外に使用しないでください。,Do not use for purposes other than those specified.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
393,ケミカル製品と接触することによって色落ちが発生する可能性がありますのでケミカル品のご使用をお避けください。,Please avoid using chemical products as contact with them may cause discoloration.,"```
MQM annotations
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/Wrong Term - The term ""ケミカル品"" is translated as ""chemical products,"" which is a reasonable translation. However, ""ケミカル製品"" is also translated as ""chemical products,"" which is redundant and slightly awkward. Although not strictly incorrect, using the same translation for two different terms in close proximity is not ideal.
```"
395,食品に触れる用途には使用しないでください。,Do not use for food contact applications.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""food contact applications"" should be translated more literally as ""applications where the item touches food"" or similar. Although ""food contact applications"" is not technically incorrect, it is a less common and potentially confusing phrasing in this context.
```"
398,※ケミカル製品と接触することによって色落ちが発生する可能性がありますのでケミカル品のご使用をお避けください。,Please avoid using chemical products as contact with them may cause discoloration.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The term ""chemical products"" should be more specific and contextually appropriate, such as ""chemical cleaning products"" or ""specific chemical agents"" to align better with the implied meaning of avoiding damage to the translated product.
```"
399,ハンドクリーナー 工業用 オレンジエキス保湿成分配合 スクラブ入り,Industrial hand cleaner with orange extract moisturizer and scrub.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""オレンジエキス保湿成分配合"" is translated as ""orange extract moisturizer"". While technically correct, it sounds awkward and unnatural. It would be better translated as ""orange extract-based moisturizer"" or ""moisturizer with orange extract"". The current translation sounds like a noun modifying another noun, rather than an adjective describing the type of moisturizer.
```"
409,異物感が残る場合は、眼科医にご相談ください。,"If a foreign body sensation remains, please consult an ophthalmologist.","```
MQM annotations:
```"
421,※使用後の本製品の廃棄は、お住まいの各自治体で定められたゴミ廃棄方法に従ってください。,Please dispose of this product according to the waste disposal methods defined by your local municipality.,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The phrase ""your local municipality"" is more common and natural than ""the waste disposal methods defined by your local municipality"". This is more of a stylistic preference, but it does impact the naturalness of the translation, hence the minor severity."
422,※袋を閉じる際は結束バンドでしっかり結んでください。,"When closing the bag, be sure to tie it securely with a cable tie.","MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""cable tie"" is a common term, but ""結束バンド"" might be more accurately translated as ""zip tie"" or ""tie wrap"" depending on the specific type of fastener. While ""cable tie"" isn't technically wrong, it might not be the most precise term in this context."
428,※本来の用途以外には使用しないでください。,Do not use for purposes other than its intended use.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
434,※フタが開けにくい際はフタを少し潰す様に押すと開けやすくなります。,"If the lid is difficult to open, pressing down on it slightly as if to crush it a little can make it easier to open.","```

435,※内容物、洗浄廃液や容器を廃棄する場合は、都道府県の許可を受けた専門の廃棄物処理業者に委託してください。,"When disposing of the contents, cleaning waste fluid, or containers, please entrust disposal to a specialized waste disposal contractor licensed by the prefectural government.","```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""cleaning waste fluid"" is a possible but less common/precise rendering of ""洗浄廃液"" than ""waste fluid from cleaning"" or ""cleaning waste liquid"" or ""waste liquid from cleaning."" It's acceptable but could be improved for clarity.
```"
438,透明度があり加工後も封入物の文字をクッキリ読めます。,It has transparency and allows you to clearly read the enclosed text even after processing.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
439,※機器には接着加工してあるシール部分から挿入してください。,Please insert from the seal area that has been bonded to the device.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""seal area"" should be more specific and accurate in the translation, potentially requiring a term like ""adhesive seal area"" or a more descriptive phrase depending on the glossary definition of what ""接着加工してあるシール部分"" represents. The current translation is too general.
```"
443,※一度加工したシートは再生不能となります。,"Once the sheet has been processed, it cannot be restored.","```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The translation ""processed"" for ""加工した"" doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""processed"" in this context. It's not necessarily wrong, but it might be better to use a word like ""modified"" or ""altered"" to convey that the sheet's properties have been changed permanently.
```"
450,※工業用の薬品やアルコール、石油製品などには絶対に使用しないで下さい。,"Do not use with industrial chemicals, alcohol, petroleum products, etc. under any circumstances.","```

451,※熱湯は入れないで下さい。,Please do not pour boiling water.,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
455,中身が漏れる恐れがございます。,The contents may leak.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""The contents"" should be ""The content"" since ""contents"" is plural in English, but ""中身"" is singular in Japanese.
```"
459,店頭でフックなどに吊り下げることができる便利な穴付きです。,Convenient hole for hanging on hooks or other fixtures in stores.,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""fixtures"" is too general. A better translation might be ""display racks"" or ""display hooks,"" depending on the specific context of the store. While ""fixtures"" is not incorrect, it's less precise and descriptive in this context.
```"
460,フック用穴と本体の間はミシン目入りなので、フックに掛けて本体を引っ張れば穴の下から切れて使える構造になっています。,"The area between the hanging hole and the main body is perforated, so you can hang it on a hook and pull the main body to tear it off from below the hole.","```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""hanging hole"" is not the most natural translation for ""フック用穴"" in this context. A more appropriate term might be ""hook hole"" or ""mounting hole."" The current translation is understandable but slightly awkward.
minor: WRONG TERM - ""main body"" is a slightly awkward translation of ""本体."" ""Body"" or ""main section"" might be more natural.
```"

MQM annotations:
```"
464,※幼児や子供がかぶって遊ぶと窒息などの危険がありますのでご注意ください。,Please be careful as there is a risk of suffocation if infants or children play with this by putting it on their heads.,"```
MQM annotations
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""suffocation"" should be ""choking"". While both relate to breathing, ""choking"" is more fitting for describing the immediate danger of an object obstructing the airway, whereas ""suffocation"" implies a more gradual process of oxygen deprivation.
```"
465,※高温多湿を避け、火の気のない場所で保管してください。,"Please store in a cool, dry place away from fire.","```
