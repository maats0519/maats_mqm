MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
Minor: culture-specific reference - The term ""リード"" (lead) may not be immediately clear to a Japanese audience as it is a direct transliteration of the English term.

audience appropriateness error:
Minor: Culture-specific Reference - The phrase ""そこにいて"" (being there) might not fully capture the idiomatic sense of ""been there"" in English, which implies having experienced something similar, often used in a context of shared understanding of common mistakes. This could slightly detract from the cultural appropriateness for a Japanese audience unfamiliar with this idiom.
