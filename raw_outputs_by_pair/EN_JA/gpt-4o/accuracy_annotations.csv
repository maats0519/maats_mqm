MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [accuracy/mistranslation] - The phrase ""true apart from any theory they might support"" is mistranslated. The translation implies that the factual statements are true ""regardless of the theories they might support,"" which slightly shifts the meaning from the source text's intent of being true ""independent of any theory.""
[Major]: [accuracy/omission] - The phrase ""for the sake of argument"" is not fully captured in the translation. The translation uses ""議論のために"" which means ""for the sake of discussion,"" but it misses the nuance of ""argument"" as a hypothetical scenario or assumption.

MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [accuracy/mistranslation] - The phrase ""theory-laden"" is not accurately translated.

MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [accuracy/omission] - The translation omits ""e.g."" (for example), which specifies that subatomic particles are an example of the facts being discussed.
[Major]: [accuracy/mistranslation] - The translation of ""coercion"" as ""強制"" (coercion) may not fully capture the nuance of the original context, which implies a broader sense of coordinated effort and pressure.

MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: None
[Major]: None
[Minor]: accuracy/mistranslation - The translation of ""superglued"" as ""スーパーボンドで貼り付けました"" is slightly inaccurate. ""スーパーボンド"" is a brand name in Japan, and while it conveys the idea of strong adhesive, it is not a direct translation of ""superglued,"" which specifically refers to using super glue.

90,And they are truly nuts.,そして彼らは本当に狂っています。,"```
MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors

Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: [accuracy/mistranslation] - The translation ""最大限の重さを持っていないかもしれない"" suggests not possessing the maximum weight, which is a mistranslation. The source implies not owning enough weights to reach the one rep max, not the maximum possible weight.
