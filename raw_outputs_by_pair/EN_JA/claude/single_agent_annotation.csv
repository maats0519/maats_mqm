7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.,科学的事実は理論に依存していると主張することは可能である。,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [mistranslation] - The translation does not fully capture the meaning of the original sentence. The original sentence suggests that even if scientific facts exist, it is still possible to argue that they are theory-laden. The translation only states that it is possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden, without the nuance of ""even if it's true that such facts exist"".

Fluency Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The translation could be improved by using a more natural Japanese sentence structure, such as ""科学的事実は理論に依存していると主張することができる"" instead of the more literal ""科学的事実は理論に依存していると主張することは可能である"".

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [mistranslation] - The translation does not fully capture the meaning of the original text. The original text suggests that certain facts can only be obtained through experiments that require significant resources, organization, and coercion, which are only possible under capitalism. The translation focuses more on the necessity of resources, organization, and coercion for the experiments, without explicitly mentioning the connection to capitalism.

Fluency Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The translation could be improved by using more natural Japanese grammar, such as ""資本主義体制でなければ、そのような実験は不可能です"" instead of ""資本主義体制でなければ不可能です"".
