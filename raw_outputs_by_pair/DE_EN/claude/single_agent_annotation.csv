If antivirus or crash guard programs are running on your system, you should close or deactivate them before starting the game. Look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option (""Deactivate"", ""Close"", or similar).

As soon as you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also terminate general background applications, as these can sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game.

463,"Ich habe mich hier durch die teils überschwänglichen Rezensionen wohl blenden lassen. Vorausschicken möchte ich, dass ich bereits 2 Rucksäcke von Lowepro im Einsatz habe. Einen sehr großen (zur Aufbewahrung der Ausrüstung) und einen ziemlich kleinen für die wichtigsten, alltäglichen Dinge, die man mal eben mitnimmt. Dadurch, dass ich mir gerade das Sigma 70-200 2.8 gekauft habe, ist der kleine Lowepro nun endgültig zu klein geworden und ich benötige Ersatz. Beim Prime Day habe ich diesen Rucksack für einen wirklich sehr erschwinglichen Preis (knapp 29 EUR) erworben und war eigentlich sehr froh über diesen Kauf, hatte ich mir doch viele der Rezensionen vorab durchgelesen. Als der Rucksack dann gestern kam, folgte die Ernüchterung: Der Rucksack ist für unter 30 EUR nicht schlecht, das kann man nicht sagen. Aber dass er (wie in vielen Rezensionen geschrieben) mit den namhaften Produkten, welche zu weit höheren Preisen verkauft werden, mithalten kann .... Leute, das stimmt einfach nicht! Ich hatte wirklich gehofft, dass es so ist, aber davon kann echt keine Rede sein. Die gepolsterten Wände sind wesentlich dünner und bieten nicht einen solchen Schutz, wie meine Lowepro. Ach die Trennungen innen, sind von einem anderen Kaliber, wesentlich labbriger. Insgesamt ist die Haptik dieses Rucksacks nicht mit der meinen Lowepro zu vergleichen. Auch die Reisverschlüsse und die Materialien der Fächer für das Kleinmaterial sind nicht gerade hochwertig. Daher habe ich für mich entschieden, dass der Rucksack zurück geht. Wenn ich mir eine Ausrüstung von vielen Tausend EUR anschaffe, dann muss ich leider auch das Geld für einen vernünftigen Rucksack in die Hand nehmen. Qualität hat hier anscheinend doch seinen Preis. Für jemanden, der nicht viel Geld ausgeben möchte, ist der Rucksack bestimmt eine gute Wahl, für mich jedoch nicht. Und es ist auch nicht so, dass mir die Entscheidung schwer gefallen ist. Als ich den Rucksack ausgepackt habe, wusste ich nach 2 Minuten, dass er zurück geht. Was mir gut gefallen hat, ist die Farbe innen. Hier findet man seine Sachen bestimmt sehr viel schneller, als mit einem grauen Innenleben. Für jemanden, der andere Ansprüche an einen Rucksack hat, ist der Rucksack bestimmt eine tolle Sache, meiner geht jedoch zurück.","I allowed myself to be dazzled by the partly effusive reviews here. I would like to preface that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a pretty small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Due to the fact that I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now become definitively too small and I need a replacement. During Prime Day, I acquired this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase, as I had read through many of the reviews in advance. But when the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that can't be said. But that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices.... People, that's just not true! I had really hoped that this was the case, but there is really no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Ah, the partitions inside are of a different caliber, much more flabby. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to my Lowepro. Also, the zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small items are not exactly high-quality. Therefore, I have decided that the backpack will be returned. If I acquire equipment worth many thousands of euros, I unfortunately have to spend the money for a decent backpack. Quality apparently does have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it would be going back. What I liked was the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - The translation ""I allowed myself to be dazzled"" does not fully capture the meaning of the original German phrase ""Ich habe mich hier durch die teils überschwänglichen Rezensionen wohl blenden lassen"", which suggests the reviewer was overly influenced by the effusive reviews.

Fluency Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - The translation ""the disillusionment followed"" could be improved to ""I was disillusioned"" to better match the original German phrasing.
[Minor]: [Punctuation] - The translation could benefit from more consistent use of punctuation, such as adding a comma after ""But when the backpack arrived yesterday"".

Therefore, Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a pity that the human being simply doesn't grasp the message behind the film, and that, although it is a mainstream film.

[Major]: [Mistranslation] - The translation incorrectly states that there are only 3 stars, when the source text mentions that the reviewer would have given 5 stars if not for the issues with the coffee flow and the additional plastic waste.
[Minor]: [Omission] - The translation omits the phrase ""in my opinion"" which is present in the source text.

Fluency Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - The translation uses the phrase ""the coffee does not flow evenly"" which is grammatically correct but could be improved to ""the coffee does not flow evenly"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Inconsistent use] - The translation uses the term ""capsules"" to refer to the original product, while the source text uses the term ""Originalkapseln"" (original capsules)."
491,"Ich habe vier Leuchtmittel im Haus durch diese Lampen ersetzt. Leider konnte ich nur vier ersetzen, denn die anderen beiden wurden ohne Fassung geliefert - stattdessen lacht mich an dieser Stelle eine Platine an... Es lag auch nichts im Karton. ""6 zahlen - 4 erhalten"" ist kein guter Deal. Bestimmt hätte Amazon das kulant und schnell geregelt, aber ich habe das erst nach der Rückgabefrist festgestellt. Somit sehe ich das zwar als meinen Fehler und lebe damit. Dennoch ist es kein gutes Indiz für die Qualität dieser Leuchtmittel - bisher der einzige Grund für zwei Sterne Abzug. Das Licht an sich ist super. Die Räume werden nun sehr hell und gleichmäßig ausgeleuchtet. Die Lichtfarbe geht eher in Richtung kaltweiß. Für Flur, Arbeitszimmer, Werkraum, Waschküche etc perfekt. Für Wohnräume würde ich persönlich zu wärmeren Licht greifen. Durchaus mit einer guten alten 100 Watt Birne vergleichbar. Das können andere Lampen allerdings auch und evtl bekomme ich dort auch intakte Exemplare entsprechend der Bestellung. Sollte meine Bewertung eine Hilfe sein, freue ich mich über eine positive Bewertung. Fragen versuche ich schnell zu beantworten.","I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, as the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board is grinning at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. ""Pay for 6, receive 4"" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have handled this generously and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period had expired. So I see this as my own mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far the only reason for a two-star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color tends more towards cool white. Perfect for the hallway, study, workshop, laundry room, etc. For living rooms, I would personally go for warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. Other lamps can do that too, and maybe I'll get intact specimens there according to the order. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive review. I'll try to answer questions quickly.","MQM annotations:

493,"Ich habe Gesten erhalten, und ich würde gerne meine erste Blick teilen. Ja positiv. Ich hab lange überlegt ob ich dieses Set bestelle, oder nicht. ** Das Material ist stabil und Es liegt gut In der Hand. **Die Utensilien haben alle am Griff ein Loch um sie aufhängen zu können ** Das weiche Silikon verkratzt teures Kochgeschirr und Töpfe nicht und ist insbesondere praktisch an Pfannen mit Beschichtung zu verwenden. **Sie sind hitzebeständig und können bis zu 440 ℉ verwendet werden. **Sie weiterleiten die Hitze auch nicht und damit können direkt angefasst werden. **Die Spülmaschine hinterlässt allerdings auf dem schwarzen Silikon manchmal Wasserflecken. Aber kurz nach wischen und sie sind weg. Schließlich Ich muss sagen, dass ich sehr überrascht bin und ich kann nur empfehlen","I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I have thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it feels good in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole in the handle to hang them. ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on coated pans. ** They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. ** They also do not conduct heat and can therefore be touched directly. ** The dishwasher, however, sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But a quick wipe and they're gone. Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it.","MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [Mistranslation] - The German word ""Gesten"" was translated as ""gestures"" instead of the more appropriate ""gestures"" or ""impressions"".

Fluency Errors
[Minor]: [Grammar] - The sentence ""I have thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not."" could be improved by using a more natural phrasing, such as ""I have given a lot of thought to whether I should order this set or not.""
[Minor]: [Punctuation] - The use of double asterisks (**) in the translation is not a common punctuation convention in English and could be replaced with more standard punctuation, such as commas or parentheses.

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [Inappropriate for context] - The term ""utensils"" may not be the most accurate translation for the German word ""Utensilien"", as it typically refers to a broader range of kitchen tools, not just the silicone items described in the review.

Overall, the translation is generally accurate and fluent, with only minor errors that do not significantly impact the comprehension of the text."

Accuracy Errors
[Minor]: [omission] - The translation omits the word ""Starker"" (powerful) from the source text.

Fluency Errors
[Minor]: [grammar] - The translation uses the incorrect noun ""mower"" instead of the more appropriate ""lawnmower"".

Terminology Errors
[Minor]: [inappropriate for context] - The term ""collection bag"" is not the most appropriate terminology for the context of a lawnmower.

Overall, the translation conveys the main meaning of the source text, but there are some minor errors in accuracy, fluency, and terminology that could be improved."
