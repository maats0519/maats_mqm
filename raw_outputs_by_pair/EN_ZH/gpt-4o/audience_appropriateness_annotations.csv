MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Major]: [CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE] - The term ""H钩"" (H hook) might not be familiar to a Chinese audience without a crochet background, as crochet hook sizes are often labeled differently in China. Providing additional context or explanation could improve understanding.

MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:

audience appropriateness error:
[Critical]: None
[Major]: CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE - The phrase ""人类将在5天后消失"" (Humanity will disappear in 5 days) might be interpreted as a literal prediction of extinction, which could be culturally alarming or inappropriate without context.

It could be slightly confusing for the target audience if they expect a more detailed or specific action.
```"

MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE] - The translation of ""Heartstopper"" as 《心跳漏一拍》 may not resonate with the target audience as it is a direct translation of the title rather than the official or commonly recognized Chinese title of the show, which is 《心跳停停》. This could cause minor confusion or lack of recognition among the audience familiar with the show.

MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE] - The term ""主管"" in Chinese can be understood as ""supervisor"" or ""manager,"" which might not fully capture the nuance of ""lead"" in a production context. This could slightly detract from the cultural appropriateness if the audience is expecting a more specific role definition.

audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [Culture-specific Reference] - The term ""铺位房间"" (bunk room) might not be a familiar or culturally appropriate term for all Chinese audiences, as it is more commonly associated with military or specific institutional settings.

audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE] - The use of ""mates"" in the source text has a casual and friendly connotation that may not be fully captured by the translation ""朋友"" (friends) in Chinese. While ""朋友"" is correct, it lacks the informal and close-knit nuance that ""mates"" implies in English-speaking cultures.
