2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.",对我来说，这是一个相当大的假设，因为它只是用一个Direct3D对象创建视口，而不是Direct3D3对象。,"```
MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: culture-specific reference/technical jargon - The terms ""Direct3D object"" and ""Direct3D3 object"" are technical jargon and while accurately translated, might not be easily understood or relevant for a general audience in all Chinese-speaking contexts. Without further context, it's difficult to determine if they need further explanation or adaptation.

10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.",某些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能通过在资本主义下才有可能进行的实验才能产生，因为这些实验需要过多的资源、过多的组织和过多的强制力，否则无法完成。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""过多的强制力"" (too much coercion) might be interpreted negatively in Chinese, depending on the context and audience. While a literal translation, it can carry connotations of authoritarianism or oppression, even in the context of scientific research. While not inherently inappropriate, it would benefit from being rephrased for certain audiences."
14,Picking this up this weekend.,这个周末去取。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/general - The translation is a bit too literal. While accurate, it lacks a more natural flow for everyday conversation in Chinese. A more natural translation might include context or clarify the object being picked up."
15,I was looking for a good first car guy car; and I really love the 80s aesthetic.,我在找一辆不错的入门级“男人味”汽车，而且我真的很喜欢80年代的审美。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: culture-specific reference/idiom - The phrase ""男人味"" (manly flavor) to describe a car is not a common or natural expression in Chinese when discussing cars, and may sound awkward or unnatural to some native speakers. While understandable, there might be more idiomatic ways to express the same idea."
19,I know they're not fast compared,我知道和别人比起来，它们不算快。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is grammatically correct but sounds a bit unnatural. A more natural translation would be ""我知道它们比不上别人的速度"" or ""我知道它们不算很快""."
20,#Venting into the Fediverse time.,在联邦宇宙倒苦水时间。,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference/jargon - The term ""联邦宇宙"" (Fediverse) might not be widely understood by the general Chinese audience without prior knowledge of decentralized social networks. While a more literal translation might lose the nuance, it could be more accessible to a broader audience."
21,The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub.,今晚我和我的同居伴侣去酒铺买了一些啤酒和一瓶香槟。,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference/terminology - While ""香槟"" is a common translation for ""bub"" (referring to champagne), it might sound slightly formal compared to the casual tone of the original English. A more colloquial term might be more appropriate for the target audience in certain contexts, although the current translation is generally acceptable."
22,"When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman.",当我们去结账时，收银员是一位相当明显的跨性别女性。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/awkward - While factually accurate, explicitly stating ""跨性别女性 (transgender woman)"" might be more direct than necessary in some Chinese contexts. A more subtle phrasing might be preferred depending on the target audience and the overall tone of the content. The phrase itself is not offensive, but the directness might be perceived differently."
25,And then we just... paid for our stuff.,然后我们就...付了钱。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is too literal and lacks natural flow for conversational Chinese. It could be improved by adding particles or rephrasing for a more natural feel. While not strictly inappropriate, it sounds slightly unnatural."
28,The smile of relief on her face was a great feeling but the fact that she was scared first FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT.,她脸上露出如释重负的笑容让人感觉很好，但她之前感到害怕这件事他妈的太糟糕了，我讨厌它。,"MQM annotations:
minor: audience_appropriateness/register - While ""他妈的"" is a direct translation of ""fucking,"" it's generally considered quite vulgar in Chinese and might be inappropriate for some audiences depending on the context. A less offensive term could have been used to convey the negative emotion."
29,This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.,这是最蠢的时间线，我讨厌它点com。,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference/literal translation - Translating "".com"" as ""点com"" is a literal translation that doesn't resonate well in Chinese. While technically correct, it's not a natural or common way to express this sentiment in Chinese online slang. A more culturally appropriate approach would be to omit it or use a more idiomatic expression to convey the frustration."
32,But he can't pardon himself out of state prison.,但他无法特赦自己出州立监狱。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/awkward - While technically accurate, the phrase ""州立监狱"" (state prison) might be more commonly understood or phrased differently in certain Chinese dialects or regions. A more natural wording could be considered depending on the target audience's linguistic preferences. However, this is a very minor point."

minor: CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE - ""festivus"" is a reference to the TV show Seinfeld, which may not be widely understood in Chinese culture, even if the general idea of a ""festival"" is. The reference adds a specific, potentially confusing layer to the translation."
61,Licht AGREED to an all Republican audience!,利希特同意面对全体共和党观众！,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference - The original segment refers to a US-centric political scenario. The translation retains this reference, which might not be as relevant or easily understood by audiences unfamiliar with US politics. The impact is minor as the general idea of facing a specific group is still conveyed."
64,The ratings--seeking delusional irresponsibility of it all.,追逐收视率的妄想般的不负责任。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error: None"
66,"I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge.",我家地下室非常漏风，这基本上意味着会有很多啮齿动物进来避难。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While not strictly an audience appropriateness issue, the translation is somewhat literal and could be phrased more naturally in Chinese. A slightly more elegant translation could be used without significantly altering the meaning."
69,"I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them.",昨晚我终于受够了这种一成不变的生活，把所有的捕鼠器都清理掉了花生酱，然后用强力胶粘了一颗开心果在上面。,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference/uncommon practice - While the translation is technically accurate, supergluing a pistachio to a mousetrap might be unusual or less common in Chinese culture, although not inherently wrong. It is a niche action, and the cultural prevalence is unknown. It does not impede understanding, but the scenario might be unfamiliar."
71,"(fwiw, I've tried nearly every ""humane"" trap on the market with very little success.",恕我直言，我尝试了市面上几乎所有“人道”的捕鼠器，但效果甚微。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While the translation is accurate, the phrase ""恕我直言"" (literally, ""forgive me for speaking directly"") might come across as slightly more formal than the original ""fwiw"" (""for what it's worth""). A less formal opening like ""说实话"" (""to be honest"") or simply omitting the introductory phrase altogether would be more natural in contemporary Chinese, depending on the context."
73,I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business.,我厌倦了保守党派和政府将自己包装成亲商的品牌。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: culture-specific reference - The phrase ""wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business"" while generally understandable, may not fully resonate with all segments of a Chinese audience in the same way it would in a Western context. The concept of political parties using branding in this way could be less familiar or carry different connotations."
74,"They aren't, at least not in Alberta.",至少在阿尔伯塔省不是。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: culture-specific reference/regionalism - While technically accurate, specifying Alberta might be less impactful for a general Chinese audience unfamiliar with Canadian provinces. A more universal phrasing could be considered."

78,"Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet.",痛苦地发现，在2023年，地方电视台的网站绝对是互联网上最糟糕的体验。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While accurate, the translation is somewhat literal and could be phrased more naturally for a Chinese audience. For example, ""痛苦地发现"" sounds slightly dramatic, and could be softened to ""令人失望的是"" or similar. This is a minor issue because it doesn't impede understanding but could sound slightly unnatural to a native speaker."
79,"Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads.",弹出窗口、自动播放视频、动画、弹出框、以及广告，广告，广告。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/verbosity - The repetition of ""广告，广告，广告"" (ads, ads, ads) is acceptable in Chinese but might be considered slightly less formal or even somewhat childish in certain contexts. While not inherently wrong, a more nuanced approach might be preferred depending on the target audience and the overall tone desired. However, without further context, it's hard to determine a more appropriate phrasing without changing the meaning."
81,"This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me.",即使在goatse.cx已经消失的现在，情况仍然如此。不过，如果要在goatse和khou.com（我在那里尝试观看Wendy发给我的视频）之间选一个最烂的网站，那将会是一场势均力敌的比赛。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Major]: [culture-specific reference/offensive content] - The reference to ""goatse.cx"" is a highly offensive and sexually explicit internet meme. While the translation accurately conveys the literal meaning, it fails to account for the extreme cultural inappropriateness of including this reference in the target text without any contextualization or mitigation. This reference would be deeply offensive and off-putting to many readers, regardless of their cultural background."

95,Yell back at those who would try to talk over us.,对那些试图盖过我们声音的人，大声回应回去。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is grammatically correct and conveys the general meaning, but it sounds somewhat forceful and less natural than it could be in Chinese. The phrase ""大声回应回去"" (dàshēng huíyìng huíqu) emphasizes shouting back, which might not always be the most appropriate response in Chinese culture. A more nuanced or diplomatic phrasing might be more culturally appropriate in certain contexts."
99,So I rushed to get into my apt to avoid him but he still managed to catch up to me to chat.,所以我赶紧冲进公寓想躲开他，但他还是追上来和我聊天了。,"MQM annotations:

102,I repeat. It is not socially acceptable to spread your covid mucus storm everywhere!!!,我再说一遍。到处散播你的新冠病毒飞沫是不被社会接受的！！！,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/register - The translation uses ""飞沫 (fēimò)"" which is a more technical and clinical term for ""droplets"" compared to what might be used in a casual, scolding context. While accurate, it may sound overly formal or scientific for the intended tone of a public health announcement or scolding."
104,Abe keeps his sorrows hidden and laughs easily while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by rude humor.,安倍把悲伤藏在心底，笑容常挂脸上；而汤姆则不怕流泪，但对粗俗的笑话不感兴趣。,"MQM annotations:
no-error"
106,Mio knows that sorrow is life's constant companion.,澪知道悲伤是人生的永恒伴侣。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While literally correct, the phrase ""永恒伴侣"" (eternal companion) sounds slightly formal and literary in modern spoken Chinese. A more natural phrasing might be ""一直都在"" (always there) or ""如影随形"" (inseparable). The current translation isn't *wrong*, but it could be more idiomatic."
108,#CNN needs to just close down.,CNN 应该倒闭了。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/blunt - While the translation is accurate, the phrasing ""应该倒闭了"" (should close down) is quite direct and blunt, which might be perceived as overly aggressive or impolite depending on the context and audience. A more nuanced or less absolute phrasing might be more appropriate in some situations."
109,Yesterday's fiasco with #MangoMoron was an outrageous fiasco.,昨天的#芒果莫伦 惨败简直是场荒唐的惨败。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [culture-specific reference/unclear reference] - ""#MangoMoron"" is likely a culture-specific reference that may not be understood by all Chinese audiences without further context. Although the translation includes the hashtag, the meaning behind it is lost without explanation."
115,"Geeky student Arnie Cunningham falls for Christine, a rusty 1958 Plymouth Fury, and becomes obsessed with restoring the classic automobile to her former glory.",书呆子学生阿尼·坎宁安爱上了克莉丝汀，一辆锈迹斑斑的1958年款普利茅斯·弗瑞，并痴迷于将这辆经典汽车修复到昔日的辉煌。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While the translation is accurate, the phrase ""昔日的辉煌"" (xīrì de huīhuáng) could be considered slightly more formal or literary than necessary for a general audience. A simpler phrasing might be more natural in modern conversational Chinese."
116,"As the car changes, so does Arnie, whose newfound confidence turns to arrogance behind the wheel of his exotic beauty.",随着汽车的改变，阿尼也随之改变，他新获得的自信在驾驶着他的异国情调的美车时变成了傲慢。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While grammatically correct, the phrase ""异国情调的美车"" (exotic beauty car) sounds slightly awkward in Chinese. A more natural phrasing might be ""充满异国情调的豪车"" (exotic luxury car) or ""他那辆漂亮的异国风情汽车"" (his beautiful exotic car). The current translation is understandable, but lacks the nuance of natural Chinese."
123,One of the craziest parts about my neighbors turning against me is thinking about how much effort it takes to be hostile.,我的邻居们与我为敌，其中最令人难以置信的一点是想到要充满敌意得需要付出多大的努力。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""充满敌意得需要付出多大的努力"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit unnatural and verbose in Chinese. A more natural phrasing would be something like ""要怀有敌意需要花费这么多心思""."
126,It hurts but you gotta do you.,虽然很伤人，但你还是要做你自己。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While the translation is accurate, it might be slightly improved for naturalness in Chinese. A more common phrasing could be used."
127,But at this point the open hostility and violence is getting worse.,但此时公开的敌意和暴力正在加剧。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While not strictly an audience appropriateness error, the phrase ""但此时"" (but at this point) might sound slightly formal or literary depending on the context. A more colloquial or conversational equivalent might be better depending on the specific audience and the overall tone of the text. However, this is very minor."
128,That takes effort.,这需要付出努力。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is technically accurate but sounds a bit formal and stilted in Chinese. While not incorrect, it could be phrased more naturally for a general audience."

134,I am aware of your hatred of Organa.,我知道你憎恨奥加纳。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The sentence structure is simple and direct, which is acceptable, but could be slightly more nuanced or formal depending on the desired tone. While not strictly an error, it might be perceived as slightly less sophisticated."
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.,《最后生还者》是“爹化”现象的一个简单而典型的例子。,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference - The term ""爹化"" (diē huà), translated as ""dad-ification"", might not be immediately understandable or resonate with all segments of the target audience without additional context or explanation. While it's a direct translation, its cultural relevance and understanding might vary."
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.",父亲化通常假定，解决父辈角色必须照顾或保护儿童或儿童替代品的情况的方法是压倒性的力量，并利用这种力量来强加一种特定形状的权力动态。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is literal and could be phrased more naturally in Chinese. For example, ""父亲化"" is not a common term. A more natural rendering might involve describing the phenomenon directly rather than using this neologism."

minor: style/readability - While accurate, the translation ""随着时间的推移，Dart成了我快速构建UI的首选"" could be slightly improved for naturalness in Chinese. A more common phrasing might be ""渐渐地，Dart成为了我快速构建UI的首选。"" or ""久而久之，Dart成为了我快速构建UI的首选。"" However, the current translation isn't incorrect, just not the most idiomatic."
160,"#flutter is a pleasure to work with, and they have #mobx for easy store management.",使用 Flutter 开发是一种享受，并且他们有 MobX 可以轻松进行状态管理。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/register - While accurate, ""状态管理"" (state management) is a more technical term. A slightly less formal option like ""管理状态"" might be marginally more accessible to a broader audience. However, this is a very minor point and the current translation is acceptable."

minor: style/awkward - While accurate, the translation is somewhat literal and could be phrased more naturally in Chinese. For example, instead of ""覆盆子色 (fù pén zi sè)"", which is technically correct, a more common expression might be used to describe raspberry-colored hair, depending on the specific shade and the desired level of colloquialism."

audience appropriateness error:
minor: culture-specific reference/names - While Bram Stoker is well-known, Max Schreck may be less familiar to the average Chinese reader. Stephenie Meyer is likely known, but it depends on the reader's familiarity with Western popular culture (specifically, vampire-themed media). This doesn't cause major confusion, but the cultural relevance is reduced."

182,Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.,因为它发生在脑海中，并且似乎不如身体健康那样有形。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is grammatically correct and conveys the meaning, but it could be phrased more naturally for a Chinese audience. Specifically, ""似乎不如身体健康那样有形"" is a bit verbose. A more concise and natural rendering might be ""不像身体健康那样看得见摸得着"". This is a minor stylistic issue that makes the translation slightly less audience-appropriate."
189,"My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.",我的生理性别为非二元性别，我的性别认同为女性。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While technically accurate, the phrasing ""我的生理性别为非二元性别"" (My physical sex is non-binary) is slightly awkward in Chinese. A more natural phrasing might be ""我的生理性别是非二元"" (My physical sex is non-binary). However, it doesn't impede understanding.
minor: terminology/inappropriate for context - The use of ""生理性别"" (physical sex) and ""性别认同"" (gender identity) is accurate but can be considered overly clinical or technical for general audiences, especially regarding non-binary identities, leading to potential confusion. While not strictly an error, a more sensitive or simplified explanation might be preferable."

196,Playing around a bit with Flutter.,稍微玩了一下 Flutter。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""稍微玩了一下"" is grammatically correct but might sound a bit too casual in some contexts. A more formal translation could be considered depending on the target audience and the overall tone desired. However, in many informal settings, this translation is perfectly acceptable."
197,"I'd hate to base my business on tech from Google, to be honest, on the other hand Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross platform experience and it shows.",说实话，我不想把我的业务建立在谷歌的技术之上。但另一方面，谷歌是少数几个真正有动力创造引人注目的跨平台体验的大公司之一，而且这一点也体现了出来。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While generally accurate, the phrasing ""而且这一点也体现了出来"" (and this is also reflected) can sound slightly formal or redundant in modern, casual Chinese, depending on the specific context. A more natural phrasing might be implied rather than explicitly stated."

204,Nothing to set alarm bells ringing but nevertheless they are being addressed.,虽无须过度担忧，但相关问题正在处理中。,"MQM annotations:

209,I don't know exactly know why my brain can't figure it out; it might be that the tools are just so broad and vague that my brain just hardlocks due to 'too many options'.,我不太清楚为什么我的大脑想不明白；可能是因为工具过于宽泛和模糊，导致我的大脑因为“选项太多”而直接卡死。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase “直接卡死” (directly freezes) is a bit too literal and informal for some contexts. While understandable, a more polished translation might use a phrase like “完全停滞” (completely stagnates) or “陷入僵局” (reaches a deadlock) for a more professional tone. The given translation is understandable, but slightly less sophisticated in style."
217,"There's... no way that would work, probably!",不太可能吧！,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/register - The source text has a tentative and informal tone (""There's... no way that would work, probably!""). The translation ""不太可能吧！"" is a reasonable translation, but it's more neutral and doesn't fully capture the same degree of tentativeness and informality. While not a major error, it's a slight shift in register."
219,I was a voracious reader in my youth.,我年轻的时候是个贪婪的读者。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/awkward - While ""贪婪的读者"" (tānlán de dúzhě) literally translates to ""greedy reader,"" it might sound slightly negative or overly intense in Chinese compared to the more common and positive connotation of ""voracious reader"" in English. A more natural and appropriate phrase in Chinese might be ""酷爱读书的人"" (kù'ài dúshū de rén) - ""a person who deeply loves reading"" or ""非常喜欢读书的人"" (fēicháng xǐhuan dúshū de rén) - ""a person who really likes to read"".

minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""这小片地方"" (this little part of) sounds slightly colloquial and could be phrased more elegantly for a broader audience. While not strictly incorrect, it lacks the formality that might be preferred in some contexts."
261,"The rain is falling and whilst/while it is not frozen, you ain't going dancing in it!",下着雨，虽然没结冰，但你也别想在雨中跳舞了！,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/register - The use of ""你也别想在雨中跳舞了！"" is slightly more forceful/colloquial than necessary given the relatively mild tone of the original English. A more neutral translation might be preferred for a broader audience."
265,Does you know of a performant way for a web component to respond to being added/removed from a document?,你知道有什么高性能的方法可以让 Web 组件响应被添加到文档或从文档中移除的事件吗？,"MQM annotations:

270,"We create a detached temp parent, install MO there, and observe it becoming detached (thus attached elsewhere).",我们创建一个分离的临时父对象，将MO安装在那里，并观察它变为分离状态（因此被附加到其他地方）。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While technically correct, the phrasing ""因此被附加到其他地方"" (therefore attached elsewhere) sounds slightly unnatural and could be simplified for a more fluent and natural reading experience in Chinese."
276,He's just absolutely ripped from tearing around my office twice a day.,他每天在我办公室里跑两趟，绝对练出来了。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/idiom - The original phrase ""absolutely ripped"" is an idiom meaning very muscular. The translation ""练出来了"" (liàn chū lái le) means ""worked out"" or ""trained and achieved results"". While not inaccurate, it loses the specific and more colloquial nuance of the original, making it less impactful and perhaps slightly less appropriate for a casual audience."

286,"All collards, kale, chard is transplanted.",所有羽衣甘蓝、芥蓝、莙荙菜都已移栽。,"MQM annotations:
major: accuracy/mistranslation - ""芥蓝"" is not a direct translation of ""kale"". While both are brassica vegetables, they are different varieties. Kale is 羽衣甘蓝. 芥蓝 is Chinese broccoli or gai lan. This might confuse a user looking for specific information on kale.
major: accuracy/mistranslation - ""莙荙菜"" is not a direct translation of ""chard"". Chard is 瑞士甜菜 (rui shi tian cai). ""莙荙菜"" is beet greens or Chinese Spinach. This might confuse a user looking for specific information on chard."

300,Could it be that Google Search is integrated with Google Maps?,Google搜索是否可能与Google地图集成？,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - The translation is grammatically correct and understandable, but the phrasing ""Google搜索是否可能与Google地图集成？"" sounds slightly formal and less natural than alternatives like ""Google搜索会不会和Google地图整合？"" or ""Google搜索有没有可能跟Google地图结合？"". This is a very subtle issue of style and naturalness for the target audience."
303,"I'm biased in favour of not releasing garbage to end users, and Apple royally fucked up with their Apple Maps when it came out in 2012.",我个人倾向于不向最终用户发布垃圾产品。 苹果2012年发布的苹果地图简直是一场灾难。,"MQM annotations:
minor: culture-specific reference/use of slang - The phrase ""royally fucked up"" is a strong and potentially offensive term. While its direct translation might be understood, it's not culturally appropriate for all Chinese audiences, especially in more formal contexts. Using less vulgar language would be more suitable."
306,The house itself declines in value because it loses its condition and needs to be replaced.,房子本身因失去状况和需要更换而贬值。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/awkward - The phrase ""失去状况"" (lose condition) is a literal translation that sounds slightly unnatural in Chinese. A more natural phrasing would be something like ""变旧"" (become old) or ""损坏"" (become damaged). While understandable, it's not the most idiomatic way to express the idea."
310,They're not stupid enough to sell the sell forever.,他们还没蠢到会永远卖下去。,"MQM annotations:

audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/awkward - The phrasing ""确保你的思想朝着某个方向思考"" (ensure your thoughts are thinking in a certain direction) is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for better flow in Chinese. A more natural phrasing might be ""引导你的思想朝着某个方向发展"" (guide your thoughts to develop in a certain direction) or similar. While not strictly inappropriate, it could be improved for a more polished feel."
321,"To all the investors out there, I raise a toast to your success and the realization of your dreams.",敬各位投资者，我举杯祝愿你们成功，梦想成真。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While generally acceptable, ""敬各位投资者"" (respectfully, to all investors) is a slightly formal tone. In some contexts, a more casual and celebratory tone might be preferred in Chinese, especially when followed by a toast. This isn't strictly an error, but worth noting for nuances in celebratory language."
322,Let us continue to work together towards creating a brighter future for all.,让我们继续携手合作，共创美好未来。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/awkward - While accurate, the phrase ""携手合作"" (xié shǒu hé zuò) and ""共创美好未来"" (gòng chuàng měi hǎo wèi lái) are very common and slightly cliché in Chinese. Although grammatically correct and understandable, they lack nuance and could be seen as slightly formulaic or uninspired depending on the context. A more sophisticated or creative phrasing might be more impactful, but it's a very minor issue."
325,I often wonder at the human capacity to be *so* down on oneself while inundated by so much evidence of what actual cruelty looks like.,我常常惊叹于人类这种能力，他们明明被如此多的关于真正残忍的证据所包围，却还能如此贬低自己。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
minor: style/awkward - While grammatically correct, the phrase ""他们明明被如此多的关于真正残忍的证据所包围，却还能如此贬低自己"" is a bit verbose and could be phrased more naturally in Chinese for a modern audience. A more concise phrasing could improve readability without changing the meaning."
327,We're all such messy critters.,我们都是这样邋遢的生物。,"MQM annotations:
audience appropriateness error:
[Minor]: [style/awkward] - While not strictly inappropriate, describing humans as ""生物 (shēngwù)"" which directly translates to ""biological organism"" or ""living thing,"" can sound overly clinical or scientific in casual conversation. A more natural phrasing might focus on the messy habits or characteristics of people rather than categorizing them as a type of organism."
332,"or ""Modal editors are useless today"" :morty:",或者“模态编辑器今天已经没用了” :morty:,"MQM annotations:

There might be a more nuanced or indirect way to express the same sentiment that would be better received."

345,"I wish there was a ""who to follow"" recommendation somehow.",我希望有个类似“推荐关注”的功能。,"MQM annotations:

347,If you stick to the default web interface it doesn't look and feel good (imho).,如果你坚持使用默认的网页界面，它看起来和用起来都不好 (恕我直言)。,"MQM annotations:
minor: style/awkward - While ""(恕我直言)"" is a literal translation of ""(imho)"", it sounds a bit more formal and less common in everyday online communication in Chinese compared to simply omitting it or using a more casual equivalent. This isn't a major error, but makes it slightly less appropriate for a casual audience."

minor: culture-specific reference/unexplained reference - The term ""Mandela effect"" might not be universally understood without further explanation or context, even though it is becoming more well-known. Providing a brief explanation could improve audience understanding, but its absence does not significantly impede understanding."

major: culture-specific reference/idiom - The translation uses a different idiom that, while conveying a similar sentiment, changes the nuance and cultural feel of the original saying. The original idiom focuses on the timing of release, while the translation focuses on the possibility of failure to create the game at all."
392,"""Or, as an industry catch phrase goes: A late game is only late until it ships.",或者，正如行业内的流行语所说：跳票的游戏迟早会发售。,"MQM annotations:
minor: CULTURE-SPECIFIC REFERENCE - While the translation is accurate, the English idiom ""A late game is only late until it ships"" might not resonate as strongly with a Chinese audience.

For a more natural translation about humanity, using a different verb would be more appropriate. A more suitable translation could be something like ""人类将于5天后消失 (rénlèi jiāng yú 5 tiān hòu xiāoshī)"" which means ""Humanity will disappear in 5 days"" or ""人类将于5天后灭绝 (rénlèi jiāng yú 5 tiān hòu mièjué)"" which means ""Humanity will be extinct in 5 days""."
