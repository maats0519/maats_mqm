463,Came home on my lunch break to see this sitting outside uwu.,午休回家，就看到这个东西坐在外面，呜呜呜。,"locale conventions:

MQM annotations:
minor: style/tone - The use of ""呜呜呜"" (wū wū wū) is a direct translation of ""uwu,"" which is an internet slang expression. While understandable, it may not be the most natural or appropriate tone for all contexts in Chinese. A more neutral or contextually relevant expression might be preferable depending on the target audience."

466,So I finally watched #Heartstopper,所以我终于看了#心跳漏一拍了。,"locale conventions:

MQM annotations:
minor: style/other - The translation is literal and doesn't sound natural in Chinese. While accurate, it lacks the nuanced understanding of online slang and cultural context in Chinese. Using ""#心跳漏一拍"" is technically correct as a translation of Heartstopper, but it feels clunky. A more natural translation in this context would acknowledge that the person just finished watching the show."
