Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: no-error
[Major]: accuracy/mistranslation - The translation changes the meaning of the original saying. The original saying means that a good game is only considered ""late"" until it is released; once it ships, it is no longer late. The translation implies that good games don't mind being released late, but the most important thing is that they are actually made.

437,I started a new shawl.,我开始织一条新的披肩。,"```
MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: none
[Major]: accuracy/addition - ""织"" (zhī), meaning ""to knit/weave"", is added to the translation. The English source ""I started a new shawl"" doesn't explicitly state the action of knitting/weaving, so adding it introduces information not present in the original text.

454,Humanity is out in 5 days.,人类将于5天后推出。,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: no-error
[Major]: accuracy/mistranslation - ""推出"" (tuīchū) typically means ""launch"" or ""release,"" which isn't quite the right fit for ""out"" in this context. While understandable, it suggests a product being released rather than humanity simply being ""out"" (likely implying gone or destroyed).

MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: no-error
[Major]: accuracy/mistranslation - ""负责人需要变更的时候"" translates to ""when your lead needs changes,"" but the intended meaning is closer to ""when changes are needed in the production environment and your lead is requesting them"" or ""when your lead is requesting changes."" The current translation implies the *lead* needs to change, not the codebase or product.

486,Work is not visible.,工作不可见。,"MQM annotations:
Accuracy Errors
[Critical]: accuracy/mistranslation - ""工作不可见"" (Gōngzuò bùkějiàn) literally translates to ""work not visible"" or ""work is invisible."" This doesn't accurately convey the likely intended meaning of ""Work is not visible,"" which could refer to work being hidden, not apparent, or not being recognized. The translation fails to capture the nuances of the original statement.
