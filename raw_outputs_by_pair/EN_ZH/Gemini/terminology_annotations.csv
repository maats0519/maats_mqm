Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""临时父对象"" might be better translated as ""临时父项"" or ""临时父级对象"" to align better with common technical terminology for ""parent object."" Although understandable, the current translation is slightly awkward.
minor: WRONG TERM - While ""分离状态"" is understandable, ""已分离"" might be a more natural and concise way to translate ""detached state"" in this context."

Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/typo - ""他每天在我办公室里跑两趟，绝对练出来了"" The translation implies physical exercise which is not the focus of the original sentence. The ""ripped"" in this context means exhausted."

MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The translation of ""collards"" as ""羽衣甘蓝"" (kale) might be technically correct, but collards is a more general term, and while kale is a type of collard, this translation doesn't reflect the broader category. Though not strictly incorrect, it's less precise. The other terms are fine.

Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/typo - ""正反两面"" is a common and correct way to translate ""both sides"", but in this specific context, it would be more accurate and natural to use ""优点和缺点"" (advantages and disadvantages) or ""积极和消极方面"" (positive and negative aspects). While not technically incorrect, ""正反两面"" sounds slightly less natural in this context.

366,Throwing everything you've got over the fence in response to GPT is not it.,把所有东西都一股脑地扔过墙来应对GPT可不是个好办法。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The phrase ""一股脑地扔过墙来"" is a bit too literal and doesn't quite capture the nuance of ""throwing everything you've got over the fence,"" which implies a desperate or reckless approach. A better translation might be something like ""孤注一掷"" (going all in) or ""不顾一切"" (regardless of consequences), depending on the specific context. The current translation is understandable, but not ideal.

Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The term “单次最大重量” is a valid translation of ""one rep max"", but in this specific context, a more colloquial and easily understood translation might be better for the general audience. However, since it is technically correct, it is only a minor issue.

376,This is my personal Mandela effect thing.,这是我个人的曼德拉效应。,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/grammatical error - The term ""曼德拉效应"" (Mandela effect) is correct in the glossary, but in this specific context, it would be more natural to use a possessive form like ""我的曼德拉效应经历"" (my Mandela effect experience) or ""我对曼德拉效应的看法"" (my view on the Mandela effect).

```"
387,"""A good game is only late until it ships.",好游戏不怕晚，就怕做不出来。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The translation ""好游戏不怕晚，就怕做不出来"" is a more descriptive paraphrase, not a direct translation of the original phrase ""A good game is only late until it ships."". Although the meaning is understandable and related, it alters the conciseness and slightly changes the implication."
392,"""Or, as an industry catch phrase goes: A late game is only late until it ships.",或者，正如行业内的流行语所说：跳票的游戏迟早会发售。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""跳票的游戏"" is a colloquial term that captures the sense of a game being delayed (""跳票""), but it's not a perfect direct translation of ""late game"" as a concept in the industry phrase. While understandable, it loses some nuance of the original phrase."
394,Is it so ephemeral then?,难道就这么短暂吗？,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/Grammatical error - The translation is grammatically correct, but in the context of a question, adding a question particle (吗) at the end might be more natural in Chinese. This is a very minor issue.

407,"You can buy ONE of the boards listed above, not one of each.",你可以购买上面列出的板子中的**一个**，不是每一个。,"```

410,We visited for a couple hours on my porch.,我们在我的门廊上拜访了几个小时。,"```
MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The translation of ""porch"" to ""门廊"" (mén láng) is technically correct but sounds overly formal. A more colloquial translation like ""阳台"" (yáng tái) or ""走廊"" (zǒu láng) might be more appropriate, depending on the context. While not incorrect, ""门廊"" carries a slightly different connotation of a grander, more formal entrance.

415,I quite like akkoma the software and the domain name I got for my instance.,我挺喜欢 Akkoma 这个软件和我为实例注册的域名。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""实例"" is an acceptable translation of ""instance"" in many contexts, but in the context of software like Akkoma, it typically refers to a specific server or installation. While technically not incorrect, using a more specific term like ""服务器"" (server) or ""安装"" (installation) would be a better fit for the context."

Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""雷普尼德虫族"" is a literal translation, while a more appropriate term might exist depending on the specific context and established terminology within the game/universe.
minor: WRONG TERM - Similar to the above, ""雷普尼德虫族"" might not be the most suitable term for the second instance. It depends on context and established conventions.

437,I started a new shawl.,我开始织一条新的披肩。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - The translation ""织"" (zhī) means ""to knit"" or ""to weave,"" which implies using needles or a loom. While technically accurate, it's more specific than the general idea of ""starting"" a shawl. A more general verb like ""开始制作"" (kāishǐ zhìzuò - start making) might be better."
442,I am using a H hook with a similar double crochet pattern as I have done before.,我正在使用一个H号钩针，用与之前相似的双钩针编织图案。,"MQM annotations:

448,The literature class hatred is even worse: I love to read.,文学课的仇恨更糟：我爱阅读。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/Wrong Term - ""文学课"" should be translated more specifically based on the context. While literally ""literature class,"" the context suggests a dislike, implying a particular course the speaker is taking. A more specific translation would be better."
454,Humanity is out in 5 days.,人类将于5天后推出。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""推出"" (tuīchū) generally means ""to launch"" or ""to release"". While it isn't strictly incorrect, it's not the most natural or accurate translation in this context. A better translation might be ""上映"" (shàngyìng) if it refers to a movie or something similar, but without more context, ""上映"" may not be appropriate. Because of the nuance missing, this is a minor error."

MQM annotations:
```"
463,Came home on my lunch break to see this sitting outside uwu.,午休回家，就看到这个东西坐在外面，呜呜呜。,"```
MQM annotations
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""呜呜呜"" is a sound effect and while commonly associated with ""uwu,"" it's not a direct translation of the abbreviation. ""uwu"" is closer to a feeling/expression/tone than a direct sound. Using the sound effect is not technically wrong, but it does not have the same connotation.

466,So I finally watched #Heartstopper,所以我终于看了#心跳漏一拍了。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""心跳漏一拍"" is a valid translation for Heartstopper, but it's not the most common or natural way to say it in Chinese. A more common translation is ""怦然心动 (pēng rán xīn dòng)"" or directly translated as ""心跳停止""."
477,"But it's important to not make excuses for issues and just fix them, especially in production when your lead needs changes.",但重要的是不要为问题找借口，而是直接修复它们，尤其是在生产环境中当你的负责人需要变更的时候。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM - ""负责人"" translated to ""负责人"" is technically correct, but in this context, ""lead"" refers to a project lead or team lead. A more appropriate translation would be ""项目负责人"" or ""团队负责人."" Although the meaning is still understandable, it's not the most natural or precise choice."
480,"Good critique is there to correct the problem quickly, and isn't directed at your ability.",好的批评是为了快速纠正问题，而不是针对你的能力。,"```
MQM annotations:
```"
485,These roots are hidden.,这些根是隐藏的。,"MQM annotations:
Terminology errors:
minor: WRONG TERM/Wrong Term - The Chinese translation is a literal translation of the English and doesn't sound natural in Chinese. While not strictly wrong, it's not the best way to express the idea in Chinese. A more natural translation might be ""这些根是隐藏起来的。"" or ""这些根隐藏起来了。"""
486,Work is not visible.,工作不可见。,"```
