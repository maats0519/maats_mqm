Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the smaller Lowepro is now too small, and I needed a replacement.

But that it (as was written in many of the reviews) can be compared to well-known products that are sold for much higher prices .... People, that is simply not true! I was really hoping that this would be true, but that is not true. The padded sides are much thinner and do not offer as much protection as my Lowepro. And the dividers inside are of a different caliber and considerably sloppier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. Ever the zippers and the materials used in the compartments for the small items, aren't even high quality. That is why I have decided to return the backpack. When I purchase equipment for many thousands of euros, then I should also spend money on a decent backpack. In this case quality also apparently has a price. For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, this is probably a good backpack, just not for me. And it's not like this was a hard decision for me to. As I was unpacking the backpack, I knew in about 2 minutes that it would be going back. What I really liked, was the color of the interior. I'm sure you can find things a lot faster than with a gray interior.

The light itself is super. The rooms are very bright not and evenly illuminated. The light color is more towards a cold white. Perfect for a hallway, study, work room, laundry room, etc. For living rooms, I would personally get a warmer light. Definitely comparable to a good old 100-watt bulb. Other lights can do this as well and maybe I will find complete examples of the lights I ordered there. Should my review be helpful, then I would be happy to give a positive review. I will try to answer any questions quickly.","I replaced four bulbs in my house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without sockets - instead, a circuit board is staring at me... There was nothing else in the box either. ""Pay for 6 - get 4"" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have resolved this amicably and quickly, but I only noticed it after the return period had expired. So, I see it as my own fault and will live with it. Nevertheless, it's not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color is more in the cool white direction. Perfect for hallways, offices, workshops, laundry rooms, etc. For living rooms, I personally would prefer warmer light. Definitely comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do that too, and maybe I'll even get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating.

493,"I received it yesterday, and would like to share my first impression. Yes, positive. I thought a long time about whether I should order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have a whole in the handle so they can be hung up. ** The soft silicon does not scratch expensive cooking pots and pans, and is especially practical to use with pans that have a coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used for heats up to 440 °F. **They also don't transfer heat so can be touched directly. **The dishwasher does, however, leave water spots on the black silicon sometimes. However, just wipe them off soon after washing and they are gone. Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend them","I received gestures, and I would like to share my first impression. Yes, positive.
